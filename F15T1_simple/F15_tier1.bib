Basic environmental factors such as soil temperature and moisture were measured. All the four investigated sites showed a positive dependence of the soil surface CO2efflux on soil temperature. The four datasets generally resulted in good agreement (up to 93{\%}) between the approaches and residual analysis showed no significant difference between approaches (less than 8{\%}). The Q10ranged between 2.0 and 2.3 among the sites. The highest spatial variation of the soil surface CO2efflux at 10 °C (expressed by the coefficient of variation CV) ranged from 30 to 65{\%} between sites. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Greenhouse gas budgets as well as the productivity of grassland systems are closely related to the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles. Within the framework of the CarboEurope and NitroEurope projects we have measured C and N exchange on the field scale at the grassland site Oensingen previously converted from arable rotation. The site is located on the Swiss Central Plateau and consists of two parallel fields of equal size. One field was subjected to intensive management with average nitrogen input of 230 kg-N ha-1year-1and 4-5 cuts per year, and the other to an extensive management with no fertilisation and less frequent cutting. The total C budget of the fields was assessed by measuring the CO2exchange by eddy covariance and analysing the carbon import by manure application and export by harvest. The N budget of the managed grassland is more complex. Besides the management related import and export, it includes gaseous exchange in many different forms (NO, NO2, HNO3, N2O, NH3, N2) needing different analytical techniques, as well as input by rain and leaching of N-compounds with the soil water. The main ("level-3") field sites in the NitroEurope project are supposed to measure 95{\%} of the N fluxes at the field scale. For several of the N fluxes specific measurements have been performed for 1 year or longer at the site. Some of the remaining N budget components (dry and wet deposition) could be estimated from results of a national deposition network, while other components (NH3and N2emission) were estimated based on literature parameterisations. However, we found indications that the (systematic) uncertainties of these estimated N-fluxes are large and that it is important to make site-specific measurement for all relevant budget components. The suitability of corresponding experimental methods is discussed. Analysis of the C budget over a 6-year period (2002-2007) showed a significant mean difference between the two newly established grassland fields with a likely net carbon loss for the extensive management and a net sequestration for the intensive management. Since the C/N ratio of the soil organic matter of the grassland is constrained in a rather narrow range around 9.3, the change in the soil carbon pool is supposed to be accompanied by a corresponding change in the N storage. This approach provided an alternative method to check the N budget of the two grassland fields derived from the individual N fluxes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract Eddy covariance was used to measure the net CO2 exchange (NEE) over ecosystems differing in land use (forest and agriculture) in Thuringia, Germany. Measurements were carried out at a managed, even-aged European beech stand (Fagus sylvatica, 70-150 years old), an unmanaged, uneven-aged mixed beech stand in a late stage of development (F. sylvatica, Fraxinus excelsior, Acer pseudoplantanus, and other hardwood trees, 0-250 years old), a managed young Norway spruce stand (Picea abies, 50 years old), and an agricultural field growing winter wheat in 2001, and potato in 2002. Large contrasts were found in NEE rates between the land uses of the ecosystems. The managed and unmanaged beech sites had very similar net CO2 uptake rates ({\~{}}-480 to -500 g C m-2 yr-1). Main differences in seasonal NEE patterns between the beech sites were because of a later leaf emergence and higher maximum leaf area index at the unmanaged beech site, probably as a result of the species mix at the site. In contrast, the spruce stand had a higher CO2 uptake in spring but substantially lower net CO2 uptake in summer than the beech stands. This resulted in a near neutral annual NEE (-4 g C m-2 yr-1), mainly attributable to an ecosystem respiration rate almost twice as high as that of the beech stands, despite slightly lower temperatures, because of the higher elevation. Crops in the agricultural field had high CO2 uptake rates, but growing season length was short compared with the forest ecosystems. Therefore, the agricultural land had low-to-moderate annual net CO2 uptake (-34 to -193 g C m-2), but with annual harvest taken into account it will be a source of CO2 (+97 to +386 g C m-2). The annually changing patchwork of crops will have strong consequences on the regions' seasonal and annual carbon exchange. Thus, not only land use, but also land-use history and site-specific management decisions affect the large-scale carbon balance.},

abstract = {Eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapour fluxes were made from June 2002 to May 2003 over a 65-year-old temperate conifer plantation forest in southern Ontario, Canada. This site is part of a newly initiated long-term tower flux measurement program over a chronosequence of white pine plantation forests, known as the Turkey Point Flux Station. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) showed a strong dependence on environmental variables such as temperature, light regime, and vapour pressure deficit. In the summer, saturation water deficit exerted a strong control on photosynthetic uptake through decreased bulk surface conductance. There was a linear relationship between monthly carbon uptake and water loss. For each kilogram of water evaporated from the stand, approximately 2.15 g of carbon was sequestered. Annual NEP was 196 g C m-2from June 2002 to May 2003. Annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) was 1442 g C m-2and annual ecosystem respiration (R) was 1247 g C m-2. A cross-site comparison of this site with 19 other, planted and natural, temperate conifer forests showed that NEP at the Turkey Point plantation was relatively low compared to other plantation forests of similar age group in Europe and North America. This analysis also showed that GEP and R of plantation forests was significantly higher than that of natural forests. In plantation forests, GEP and NEP linearly decreased with forest age, while R decreased little. Natural stands showed an increase in GEP and R with stand age, except for an old growth stand in western USA. This showed that photosynthesis, rather than respiration, plays a dominant role in net carbon uptake of both plantation and natural forests. In both, plantation and natural, stands there was a weak or no relationship between NEP and annual temperature and precipitation, while annual GEP and R was positively correlated to these environmental variables. The differences in carbon uptake among plantations and between plantation and natural temperate conifer forests were due more to physical and physiological differences among stands (e.g. stand age, tree density, leaf area index, site history, and adopted management practices in case of plantation forests), rather than differences in environmental variables. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Inter-annual variability in primary production and ecosystem respiration was explored using eddy-covariance data at a semi-arid savanna site in the Kruger Park, South Africa. New methods of extrapolating night-time respiration to the entire day and filling gaps in eddy-covariance data in semi-arid systems were developed. Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in these systems occurs as pulses associated with rainfall events, a pattern not well-represented in current standard gap-filling procedures developed primarily for temperate flux sites. They furthermore do not take into account the decrease in respiration at high soil temperatures. An artificial neural network (ANN) model incorporating these features predicted measured fluxes accurately (MAE 0.42 gC/m(2)/day), and was able to represent the seasonal patterns of photosynthesis and respiration at the site. The amount of green leaf area (indexed using satellite-derived estimates of fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation fAPAR), and the timing and magnitude of rainfall events, were the two most important predictors used in the ANN model. These drivers were also identified by multiple linear regressions (MLR), with strong interactive effects. The annual integral of the filled NEE data was found to range from -138 to + 155 g C/m(2)/y over the 5 year eddy covariance measurement period. When applied to a 25 year time series of meteorological data, the ANN model predicts an annual mean NEE of 75(+/- 105) g C/m(2)/y. The main correlates of this inter-annual variability were found to be variation in the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), length of the growing season, and number of days in the year when moisture was available in the soil.},

abstract = {Background: Large spatial, seasonal and annual variability of major drivers of the carbon cycle (precipitation, temperature, fire regime and nutrient availability) are common in the Sahel region. This causes large variability in net ecosystem exchange and in vegetation productivity, the subsistence basis for a major part of the rural population in Sahel. This study compares the 2005 dry and wet season fluxes of CO2 for a grass land/sparse savanna site in semi arid Sudan and relates these fluxes to water availability and incoming photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Data from this site could complement the current sparse observation network in Africa, a continent where climatic change could significantly impact the future and which constitute a weak link in our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Results: The dry season (represented by Julian day 35–46, February 2005) was characterized by low soil moisture availability, low evapotranspiration and a high vapor pressure deficit. The mean daily NEE (net ecosystem exchange, Eq. 1) was -14.7 mmol d-1 for the 12 day period (negative numbers denote sinks, i.e. flux from the atmosphere to the biosphere). The water use efficiency (WUE) was 1.6 mmol CO2 mol H2O-1 and the light use efficiency (LUE) was 0.95 mmol CO2 mol PPFD-1. Photosynthesis is a weak, but linear function of PPFD. The wet season (represented by Julian day 266–273, September 2005) was, compared to the dry season, characterized by slightly higher soil moisture availability, higher evapotranspiration and a slightly lower vapor pressure deficit. The mean daily NEE was -152 mmol d-1 for the 8 day period. The WUE was lower, 0.97 mmol CO2 mol H2O-1 and the LUE was higher, 7.2 $\mu$mol CO2 mmol PPFD-1 during the wet season compared to the dry season. During the wet season photosynthesis increases with PPFD to about 1600 $\mu$mol m-2s-1 and then levels off. Conclusion: Based on data collected during two short periods, the studied ecosystem was a sink of carbon both during the dry and wet season 2005. The small sink during the dry season is surprising and similar dry season sinks have not to our knowledge been reported from other similar savanna ecosystems and could have potential management implications for agroforestry. A strong response of NEE versus small changes in plant available soil water content was found. Collection and analysis of flux data for several consecutive years including variations in precipitation, available soil moisture and labile soil carbon are needed for understanding the year to year variation of the carbon budget of this grass land/sparse savanna site in semi arid Sudan.},

abstract = {Eddy co-variance measurements of water vapour and CO2fluxes were performed for 15 months at the Vielsalm experimental site (Belgian Ardennes). The forest is patchy, made up of mixed coniferous (Douglas fir) and deciduous (beech) plots. The experiment was developed as a part of the EUROFLUX and ECOCRAFT projects. The experimental set-up has been shown to provide reliable flux estimates provided that an adequate frequency correction is applied. A simple footprint model was used in order to separate the contributions to the flux of the conifer and the beech sub-plots. Saturation net ecosystem exchange decreased with increasing air saturation deficit and with decreasing temperature below 15°C. Dark respiration and quantum efficiency decreased with decreasing soil water content and, below 15°C, with decreasing temperature. These responses explain most of the seasonal behaviour of the CO2fluxes. Generally, the differences between the beech and the coniferous sub-plots were low during the full vegetation period. The differences were significant in early spring and late autumn when the leaves in the beech sub-plot were not fully developed or senescent. A relation between night CO2flux (Ne) and temperature was established. During periods of little turbulent mixing at night, there was a considerable scatter in the plot of Neversus temperature; however, after selection of the data using an appropriate turbulence criterion, a well-defined relationship between Neand temperature was established. An optimal criterion was found to be u*{\textgreater} 0.4-0.5 m s-1. No clear difference in Nebetween the conifer and the beech sub-plots was detected, probably because of bad footprint conditions at night. A first estimate of the annual carbon sequestration was made by summing the half-hourly Neand filling in the data gaps resulting from system failures or from removal of data that did not fit the quality criteria. It was found to be -0.60 kg m-2per year. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {It is necessary to partition eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange into its offsetting gross fluxes, canopy photosynthesis, and ecosystem respiration, to understand the biophysical controls on the net fluxes. And independent estimates of canopy photosynthesis (G) and ecosystem respiration (R) are needed to validate and parametrize carbon cycle models that are coupled with climate and ecosystem dynamics models. Yet there is a concern that carbon flux partitioning methods may suffer from spurious correlation because derived values of canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration both contain common information on net carbon fluxes at annual time scales. We hypothesized that spurious correlation among canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration can be minimized using day-night conditional sampling of CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} exchange; daytime fluxes are dominated by photosynthesis and nighttime fluxes are dominated by respiration. To test this hypothesis, we derived explicit equations that quantify the degree of spurious correlation between photosynthesis and respiration. Theoretically, day and night samples of net carbon exchange share a different common variable, daytime ecosystem respiration, and the degree of spurious correlation depends upon the variance of this shared variable. We then applied this theory to ideal measurements of carbon exchange of over a vigorous, irrigated, and frequently harvested alfalfa field in the sunny and windy region of California, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where soil CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} efflux is strong. In this case, we found that the correlation coefficient between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration was -0.79. This relatively high correlation between canopy photosynthesis and respiration was mostly real as the degree of spurious correlation was only -0.32.We then expanded this analysis to the FLUXNET database that spans a spectrum of climate and plant functional types. We found, on average, that the correlation between gross photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration, using day-night sampling, was close to minus one (-0.828. ±. 0.130). For perspective, a large fraction of this correlation was real, as the degree of spurious correlation (Eq. (22)) was -0.526. We conclude that the potential for spurious correlation between canopy photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration across the FLUXNET database was moderate. Looking across the database, we found that the least negative spurious correlations coefficients ({\textgreater}-0.3) were associated with seasonal deciduous forests. The most negative spurious correlations coefficients ({\textless}-0.7) were associated with evergreen forests found in boreal climates.},

abstract = {Steppe ecosystems represent an interesting case in which the assessment of carbon balance may be performed through a cross validation of the eddy covariance measurements against ecological inventory estimates of carbon exchanges (Ehman, 2002; Curtis, 2002). Indeed, the widespread presence of ideal conditions for the applicability of the eddy covariance technique, as vast and homogeneous grass vegetation cover over flat terrains (Baldocchi, 2003), make steppes a suitable ground to ensure a constrain to flux estimates with independent methodological approaches. We report about the analysis of the carbon cycle of a true steppe ecosystem in southern Siberia during the growing season of 2004 in the framework of the TCOS-Siberia project activities performed by continuous monitoring of CO2 fluxes at ecosystem scale by the eddy covariance method, fortnightly samplings of phytomass, and ingrowth cores extractions for NPP assessment, and weekly measurements of heterotrophic component of soil CO2 effluxes obtained by an experiment of root exclusion. The carbon balance of the monitored natural steppe was, according to micrometeorological measurements, a sink of carbon of 151.730.1 gC m-2, cumulated during the growing season from May to September. This result was in agreement with the independent estimate through ecological inventory which yielded a sink of 150.1 gC m-2 although this method was characterized by a large uncertainty (130{\%}) considering the 95{\%} confidence interval of the estimate. Uncertainties in belowground process estimates account for a large part of the error. Thus, in particular efforts to better quantify the dynamics of root biomass (growth and turnover) have to be undertaken in order to reduce the uncertainties in the assessment of NPP. This assessment should be preferably based on the application of multiple methods, each one characterized by its own merits and flaws.},

abstract = {Although mature black spruce forests are a dominant cover type in the boreal forest of North America, it is not clear how their carbon (C) budgets vary across the continent. The installation of an eddy covariance flux tower on an Old Black Spruce (OBS) site in eastern Canada (EOBS, Qu�bec) provided a first opportunity to compare and contrast its annual (2004) and seasonal C exchange with two other pre-existing OBS flux sites from different climatic regions located in Saskatchewan [Southern OBS (SOBS)] and Manitoba [Northern OBS (NOBS)]. Although there was a relatively uniform seasonal pattern of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) among sites, EOBS had a lower total annual NEP than the other two sites. This was primarily because warmer soil under a thicker snowpack at EOBS appeared to increase winter C losses and low light suppressed both NEP and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) in June. Across sites, greater total annual GEP and ecosystem respiration (R) were associated with greater mean annual air temperatures and an earlier beginning of the growing season. Also, GEP at all three sites showed a stronger relationship with air temperature in spring and early summer compared with later in the growing season, highlighting the importance of springtime conditions to the C budget of these boreal ecosystems. The three sites had different parameter estimates describing the responses of R and GEP at the half hour time scale to near surface temperature and light, respectively. On the other hand, the responses of both R and GEP to temperature at the monthly scale did not differ among sites. These results suggest that a general parameterization could be sufficient at coarse time resolutions to model the response of C exchange to environmental factors of mature black spruce forests from different climatic regions},

Variability in ecosystem characteristics alters biophysical and biogeochemical processes that can affect regional to global circulation patterns, which are not well characterized by land surface models. We initiated a multidisciplinary field campaign called Savanna Patterns of Energy and Carbon Integrated across the Landscape (SPECIAL) during the dry season in Australian savannas to understand the spatial patterns and processes of land surface–atmosphere exchanges (radiation, heat, moisture, CO2, and other trace gasses).

abstract = {Savannas comprise a large proportion of the terrestrial land surface and are highly varied in their composition, structure and function. These characteristics alter land-atmosphere exchanges of heat, water, carbon dioxide and other trace gases, which feed back to the climate at multiple scales. Australian savannas provide significant ecosystem services and further systematic scientific study is needed to sustainably manage these ecosystems. We undertook an interdisciplinary research effort to understand the patterns and processes of carbon, water and energy cycles across northern Australian landscapes across scales from point to region. We quantified the land surface-atmosphere exchanges across the vast region of Australian savannas using a hierarchical, integrated measurement and modelling approach to determine regional greenhouse gas and water budgets. The research team comprised groups from seven institutions and four countries. The research effort comprised of a multi- year measurement and modelling endeavour and culminated in an intensive field program held in September 2008 (late dry season). The program aimed to improve our knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of land-atmosphere exchanges and the processes driving them as well as our ability to remotely sense them and simulate them using land surface models, which are crucial components of Global Climate Models. We attempted to robustly integrate small scale processes, such as leaf photosynthesis to larger scales applicable to modelling and remote sensing for the savanna region. In this paper we provide the scientific background and our overall approach to the program with reference to the papers in this "Savanna Patterns of Energy and Carbon Integrated Across the Landscape" (SPECIAL) issue. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}OzFlux is the regional Australian and New Zealand flux tower network that aims to provide a continental-scale national research facility to monitor and assess trends, and improve predictions, of Australia's terrestrial biosphere and climate. This paper describes the evolution, design and current status of OzFlux as well as an overview of data processing. We analyse measurements from the Australian portion of the OzFlux network and found that the response of Australian biomes to climate was largely consistent with global studies but that Australian systems had a lower ecosystem water-use efficiency. Australian semi-arid/arid ecosystems are important because of their huge extent (70 {\%}) and they have evolved with common moisture limitations. We also found that Australian ecosystems had similar radiation use efficiency per unit leaf area compared to global values that indicates a convergence toward a similar biochemical efficiency. The paper discusses the utility of the flux data and the synergies between flux, remote sensing and modelling. Lastly, the paper looks ahead at the future direction of the network and concludes that there has been a substantial contribution by OzFlux and considerable opportunities remain to further advance our understanding of ecosystem response to disturbances including drought, fire, land use and land cover change, land management and climate change that are relevant both nationally and internationally. It is suggested that a synergistic approach is required to address all of the spatial, ecological, human and cultural challenges of managing the delicately balanced ecosystems in Australia.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Savannas comprise a large area of the global land surface and are subject to frequent disturbance through fire. The role of fire as one of the primary natural carbon cycling mechanisms is a key issue in considering global change feedbacks. The savannas of Northern Australia burn regularly and we aimed to determine their annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and the impact of fire on productivity. We established a long-term eddy covariance flux tower at Howard Springs, Australia and present here 5 years of data from 2001 to 2005. Fire has direct impacts through emissions but also has indirect effects through the loss of productivity due to reduced functional leaf area index and the carbon costs of rebuilding the canopy. The impact of fire on the canopy latent energy exchange was evident for 40 days while the canopy was rebuilt; however, the carbon balance took approximately 70 days to recover. The annual fire free NEP at Howard Springs was estimated at ?4.3 tCha?1 yr?1 with a range of ?3.5 to ?5.1 tCha?1 yr?1 across years. We calculated the average annual indirect fire effect as 10.7 tCha?1 yr?1 using a neural network model approach and estimated average emissions of fine and coarse fuels as 11.6 tCha?1 yr-1. This allowed us to calculate a net biome production of ?2.0 tCha?1 yr-1. We then partitioned this remaining sink and suggest that most of this can be accounted for by woody increment (1.2 tCha?1 yr-1) and shrub encroachment (0.5 tCha?1 yr-1). Given the consistent sink at this site, even under an almost annual fire regime, there may be management options to increase carbon sequestration by reducing fire frequency.},

These greenhouse gases, along with carbon dioxide (CO2), are the three most prominent atmospheric constituents contributing to current global warming. This study investigates the exchange of CH4, N2O and CO2exchange in an Australian tropical ephemeral wetland (Fogg Dam) and the environmental factors controlling these fluxes. Wetland Net Ecosystem Production (NEP) was determined using CO2exchange measurements using eddy covariance over 3 years. CH4and N2O gas exchanges were measured in short campaigns during December 2006 (dry season) and February and March 2007 (wet season). The extensive coverage of vegetation in the wetland during both wet and dry seasons led to a large annual NEP (sink) of +1129.4±70.4gCO2m-2yr-1or +3.07MgCha-1y-1. Instantaneous, non-CO2fluxes of CH4and N2O on a CO2equivalent basis were near zero during the dry season. However, during the wet season the CH4source offsets approximately 93{\%} of the CO2sink, and N2O emission offset {\textless}1{\%} of the CO2sink. The primary environmental factor controlling the greenhouse gas emissions was soil water content as temperature did not vary significantly seasonally. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The lack of information on the ways seasonal drought modifies the CO2 exchange between Neotropical rainforest ecosystems and the atmosphere and the resulting carbon balance hinders our ability to precisely predict how these ecosystems will respond as global environmental changes force them to face increasingly contrasting conditions in the future. To address this issue, seasonal variations in daily net ecosystem productivity (NEPd) and two main components of this productivity, daily total ecosystem respiration (REd) and daily gross ecosystem productivity (GEPd), were estimated over 2 years at a flux tower site in French Guiana, South America (5 °16′54″N, 52 °54′44″W). We compared seasonal variations between wet and dry periods and between dry periods of contrasting levels of intensity (i.e. mild vs. severe) during equivalent 93-day periods. During the wet periods, the ecosystem was almost in balance with the atmosphere (storage of 9.0 g C m−2). Seasonal dry periods, regardless of their severity, are associated with higher incident radiation and lower REd combined with reduced soil respiration associated with low soil water availability. During the mild dry period, as is normally the case in this region, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem was 32.7 g C m−2. Severe drought conditions resulted in even lower REd, whereas the photosynthetic activity was only moderately reduced and no change in canopy structure was observed. Thus, the severe dry period was characterized by greater carbon storage (64.6 g C m−2), emphasizing that environmental conditions, such as during a severe drought, modify the CO2 exchange between Neotropical rainforest ecosystems and the atmosphere and potentially the resulting carbon balance.},

abstract = {The net exchanges of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and energy were examined in a perennial Colorado Plateau grassland for 5 years. The study began within a multiyear drought and continued as the drought ended. The grassland is located near the northern boundary of the influence of the North American monsoon, a major climatic feature bringing summer rain. Following rain, evapotranspiration peaked above 8 mm d−1 but was usually much smaller (2–4mmd−1). Net productivity of the grassland was low compared to other ecosystems, with peak hourly net CO2 uptake in the spring of 4 mmol m−2 s−1 and springtime carbon gain in the range of 42 ± 11 g C m−2 (based on fluxes) to 72 ± 55 g C m−2 (based on carbon stocks; annual carbon gain was not quantified). Drought decreased gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and total ecosystem respiration, with a much larger GEP decrease. Monsoon rains led to respiratory pulses, lasting a few days at most, and only rarely resulted in net CO2 gain, despite the fact that C4 grasses dominated plant cover. Minor CO2 uptake was observed in fall following rain. Spring CO2 uptake was regulated by deep soil moisture, which depended on precipitation in the prior fall and winter. The lack of CO2 uptake during the monsoon and the dependence of GEP on deep soil moisture are in contrast with arid grasslands of the warm deserts. Cold desert grasslands are most likely to be impacted by future changes in winter and not summer precipitation.},

Australia's tropical savannas occupy over 25 {\%} of the continental land mass and have a potential to significant influence the national greenhouse gas budget, particularly because they are the focus of likely agricultural expansion. To investigate the role of deforestation on GHG emissions, a paired site approach was used. The CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} exchange was measured from two tropical savanna woodland sites, one that was cleared, and a second analogue site that remained uncleared for a 22 month observation period. At both sites, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured using the eddy covariance (EC) method.

This was added to net CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} fluxes as measured by the eddy covariance tower giving a total GHG emission of 154 Mg CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}-e ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} from a savanna woodland with a total fuel load (above- and below- ground woody debris, course woody debris, litter plus C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} grass fuel) of 40.9 Mg C ha{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.

At current rates of deforestation, savanna burning is as significant a source of GHG emissions as deforestation, with fire emissions occurring every year across this savanna biome. However, expanded deforestation could exceed fire emissions and a clearing scenario was examined which suggested clearing over and above current rates could add up to 5 {\%} to Australia's national GHG account, depending on the annual rate of deforestation. This bottom-up study provides data that can reduce uncertainty associated with land use change for this extensive tropical ecosystem and provide an assessment of the relative magnitude of GHG emissions from savanna burning and deforestation as well as informing northern land use decision making processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Seasonal changes in NEE, GPP and RE were tightly correlated, with extremes in July and December/January. Nonetheless, maximum rates of RE slightly lagged behind the maximum rates of GPP. We observed a substantial increase in NEE at optimum light conditions (reduced uptake) above 24°C. Because this increase is unlikely to be related only to the increase in RE, we hypothesize that it also indicates a significant decrease in GPP under dry and warm meteorological conditions. Because this increase in NEE was better correlated with atmospheric vapour pressure deficit than with temperature, we further hypothesize that the observed change in NEE was predominantly related to the effect of high atmospheric evaporative demand on GPP via stomatal closure than to a negative-temperature response. Because dry conditions were rare in the maritime climate of this study site, its impact on the annual GPP or even on NEE was small ({\textless}1{\%} and 10{\%}, respectively). {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Leaf-level photosynthetic parameters of species in the closely related genera Eucalyptus and Corymbia were assessed along a strong rainfall gradient in northern Australia. Both instantaneous gas exchange measurements and leaf carbon isotope discrimination indicated little variation in intercellular CO2concentrations during photosynthesis (ci) in response to a decrease in mean annual precipitation from {\~{}}1700mm to {\~{}}300mm. Correlation between stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity contributed toward the maintenance of relatively constant ciamong the sampled leaves, when assessed at ambient CO2concentration and photon irradiance similar to full sunlight. Leaf mass per area was the most plastic leaf trait along the rainfall gradient, showing a linear increase in response to decreasing mean annual precipitation. The maximum Rubisco carboxylation velocity, Vcmax, expressed on a leaf-area basis, showed a modest increase in response to decreasing rainfall. This modest increase in Vcmaxwas associated with the strongly expressed increase in leaf mass per area. These results suggest that variation in ecosystem-level gas exchange during the dry season in north-Australian savannas will likely be dominated by changes in leaf area index in response to increasing aridity, rather than by changes in photosynthetic performance per unit leaf area. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Land use change and grassland degradation are two of the most critical problems ubiquitously found in arid and semi-arid areas in Northern China. Energy fluxes, including net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H) and soil heat flux (G), were examined over an entire year (December 2005 to November 2006) in different steppe ecosystems - the steppe and cropland in Duolun and the fenced and grazed steppe in Xilinhot - in Inner Mongolia based on direct measurements from four eddy-covariance flux towers. The seasonal changes in Rn, LE, H and G of the four sites were similar, with very low values during the period of snow cover from December to February, followed by a gradual increase in the growing season. The opposite seasonal patterns of the LE and H fraction resulted in significant seasonal changes in Bowen ratio ($\beta$). Human activity in cropland ecosystems not only resulted in a rapidly shift between LE and H, but also triggered a decrease in latent heat fraction because of a shortened growing season of crop plants. The significantly positive relationships between canopy surface conductance (gc) and LE/LEeqof all of the study sites suggested that a lack of precipitation coupled with high VPD conduced remarkable decreases of stomatal conductance. This could impede the latent heat partitioning of available energy (Rn- G) in semi-arid ecosystems, Inner Mongolia. The obvious decrease in the values of gcand the decoupling factor ($\Omega$) in both the cropland and the degraded steppe suggested that land use change could depress latent flux fraction and increase its sensitivity to air and soil drought. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The current paper illustrates a method to operationally apply the model FOREST-BGC for the estimation of forest carbon fluxes in Mediterranean environments. The work was carried out in a pine forest stand within the coastal area of San Rossore (Central Italy) using both conventionally collected and remotely sensed data. The calibration of the model was performed using estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) derived from the carbon accumulated in the forest stems during the last four decades. Such estimates were obtained by transforming dendrochronological measurements collected in the stand into annual increments of woody biomass and carbon matter. Next, the model performance was validated against values of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary productivity (GPP) collected during four years (1999-2002) by an eddy covariance flux tower. A method based on deriving fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) from remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) data was also calibrated and validated in order to more directly assess forest GPP. The results achieved indicate that the multi-year calibration against past carbon accumulation was essential in properly configuring the model in terms of respiration and allocation functions. Due to the importance of these functions, only the calibrated model was in fact able to correctly simulate the forest carbon fluxes, giving monthly estimates of both NEE and GPP quite close to those measured by the flux tower. These estimates were further improved by the proper integration of remotely sensed GPP evaluation and model carbon partitioning, which could be particularly useful for operational monitoring applications on a regional scale. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Tropical primary rainforests of Africa are an enormous reservoir of carbon (C), most of which, in the common perception, is stored in the biomass. We studied one of these forests, Ankasa, in the south-western part of Ghana, in terms of quantity and 14C activity of soil organic carbon (SOC) to elucidate the little known important role of soil in storing carbon in such biomass-rich environments. The stock of carbon in the mineral soil to a depth of 1 m was measured to be 151 ± 20 Mg C ha−1, a similar value in magnitude to the one of the aboveground biomass being 138–170 Mg C ha−1, including live and dead wood. Surface litter C is roughly 10{\%} (15 ± 9 Mg C ha−1) of the C in the biomass and soil. The radiocarbon measurements indicate that SOC was significantly affected by “bomb C” enrichment, so that “Modern C”, namely with a mean radiocarbon age lower than 200 years, is present also deeper than 45 cm in the Bo2 horizon. The mean residence time (MRT) estimated from radiocarbon content are of the order of a few decades in the topsoil and a few centuries in the deeper horizons. Altogether, the MRT values indicate a fast recycle of C compared to temperate or boreal forests, but not as fast as usually believed for tropical forest soils. Making a pondered mean, in the Ankasa forest the time an atom of C resides in soil is not much different from one atom of C in the woody aboveground biomass. Hence, the contribution of soil in storing C is substantial, implying that in primary rainforests it is mandatory to determine the SOC stock and its dynamics, too often neglected or underestimated.},

abstract = {Net ecosystem carbon dioxide (FCO2) and methane (FCH4) exchanges were measured by using the eddy covariance method to quantify the atmospheric carbon budget at a Typha- and Nymphaea-dominated freshwater marsh (March 2011 to March 2013) and a soybean cropland (May 2011 to May 2012) in northwestern Ohio, USA. Two year average annual FCH4 (49.7 g C-CH4 m−2 yr−1) from the marsh was high and compatible with its net annual CO2 uptake (FCO2: −21.0 g C-CO2 m−2 yr−1). In contrast, FCH4 was small (2.3 g C-CH4 m−2 yr−1) and accounted for a minor portion of the atmospheric carbon budget (FCO2: −151.8 g C-CO2 m−2 yr−1) at the cropland. At the seasonal scale, soil temperature associated with methane (CH4) production provided the dominant regulator of FCH4 at the marsh (R2 = 0.86). At the diurnal scale, plant-modulated gas flow was the major pathway for CH4 outgassing in the growing season at the marsh. Diffusion and ebullition became the major pathways in the nongrowing season and were regulated by friction velocity. Our findings highlight the importance of freshwater marshes for their efficiency in turning over and releasing newly fixed carbon as CH4. Despite marshes accounting for only {\~{}}4{\%} of area in the agriculture-dominated landscape, their high FCH4 should be carefully addressed in the regional carbon budget.},

abstract = {Vast areas in the interior of Australia are exposed to regular but infrequent periods of heavy rainfall, interspersed with long periods at high temperatures, but little is known of the carbon budget of these remote areas or how they respond to extreme precipitation. In this study, we applied three methods to partition net ecosystem photosynthesis into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Re) during two years of contrasting rainfall. The first year was wet ({\textgreater}250 mm above average rainfall), while little precipitation fell during the second year ({\textgreater}100 mm below average). During the first year of study, rates of GPP were large (793 g C m-2 yr-1) in this semi-arid Mulga (Acacia aneura) and grass savanna due to complementary photosynthetic responses by the canopy and C4 understorey to cycles of heavy rainfall. Patterns in GPP during the summer and autumn matched those in leaf area index (LAI), photosynthetic activity, and autotrophic respiration. During the dry year, small but positive photosynthetic uptake by Mulga contributed to the neutral carbon budget (GPP / Re = 1.06 ± 0.03). Small rates of photosynthesis by evergreen Mulga when dry were supported by storage of soil moisture above a relatively shallow hardpan. Little soil organic matter (1.1{\%}) was available to support heterotrophic respiration (Rh) without input of fresh substrate. The two largest sources of Re in this study were autotrophic respiration by the seasonal understorey and Rh through decomposition of fresh organic matter supplied by the senescent understorey. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Global carbon balances are increasingly affected by large fluctuations in productivity occurring throughout semiarid regions. Recent analyses found a large C uptake anomaly in 2011 in arid and semiarid regions of the southern hemisphere. Consequently, we compared C and water fluxes of two distinct woody ecosystems (a Mulga (Acacia) woodland and a Corymbia savanna) between August 2012 and August 2014 in semiarid central Australia, demonstrating that the 2011 anomaly was short-lived in both ecosystems. The Mulga woodland was approximately C neutral but with periods of significant uptake within both years. The extreme drought tolerance of Acacia is presumed to have contributed to this. By contrast, the Corymbia savanna was a very large net C source (130 and 200gCm-2yr-1in average and below average rainfall years, respectively), which is likely to have been a consequence of the degradation of standing, senescent biomass that was a legacy of high productivity during the 2011 anomaly. The magnitude and temporal patterns in ecosystem water-use efficiencies (WUE), derived from eddy covariance data, differed across the two sites, which may reflect differences in the relative contributions of respiration to net C fluxes across the two ecosystems. In contrast, differences in leaf-scale measures of WUE, derived from13C stable isotope analyses, were apparent at small spatial scales and may reflect the different rooting strategies of Corymbia and Acacia trees within the Corymbia savanna. Restrictions on root growth and infiltration by a siliceous hardpan located below Acacia, whether in the Mulga woodland or in small Mulga patches of the Corymbia savanna, impedes drainage of water to depth, thereby producing a reservoir for soil moisture storage under Acacia while acting as a barrier to access of groundwater by Corymbia trees in Mulga patches, but not in the open Corymbia savanna.},

abstract = {Turbulent fluxes of carbon, water vapor, and temperature were continuously measured above an upland forest in north central Wisconsin during 1999 and 2000 using the eddy covariance method. Maple (Acer saccharum), basswood (Tilia americana), and green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica) species found in this forest also comprise a substantial portion of the landscape in the northern Great Lakes region and area, and it has been hypothesized that forests of this age (60-80 years) are responsible for net uptake of atmospheric CO2over North America. Mean CO2, water vapor, and temperature profile measurements were used to improve flux estimates during periods of low turbulence, and were effective for friction velocities (u*) {\textgreater}0.3 m s-1. Unique observations at this site included nighttime and early morning venting anomalies that seemed to originate from a seemingly homogenous area within the forest. These elevated NEE measurements, some as high as 80 mol m-2s-1, appeared in valid turbulent flux observations for hours at a time, and provided circumstantial evidence for preferential venting and/or existence of pooled CO2in low-lying areas. We observed that the forest was a moderate sink for atmospheric carbon, and cumulative NEE of CO2was estimated to be -334 g C m-2year-1during 2000. Sensitivity to low-turbulence flux corrections was very small (21 g C m-2year-1), and discrepancies between annual estimates of NEE and NEP were similar to other sites. A normalized measure of ecosystem respiration, the free energy of activation, was presented and its seasonal variations were analyzed. Gross ecosystem production (GEP) was high (1165 g C m-2year-1) and ecosystem respiration (ER) was low (817 g C m-2year-1) in comparison to spatially integrated, landscape-scale observations from WLEF (914 and 1005 g C m-2year-1, respectively), a 477 m tower located 22 km to the northeast [Glob. Change Biol. 9 (2003) 1278]. Forest transpiration was responsible for most of the water released to the atmosphere. Stomata closed under intense sunlight and high vapor pressure deficits (VPD {\textgreater} 1.5 kPa). Effect of stomotal closure on annual CO2uptake was minimal due to adequate soil moisture and moderate VPD during the growing season. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Although the analysis of flux data has increased our understanding of the interannual variability of carbon inputs into forest ecosystems, we still know little about the determinants of wood growth. Here, we aimed to identify which drivers control the interannual variability of wood growth in a mesic temperate deciduous forest. We analysed a 9-yr time series of carbon fluxes and aboveground wood growth (AWG), reconstructed at a weekly time-scale through the combination of dendrometer and wood density data. Carbon inputs and AWG anomalies appeared to be uncorrelated from the seasonal to interannual scales. More than 90{\%} of the interannual variability of AWG was explained by a combination of the growth intensity during a first 'critical period' of the wood growing season, occurring close to the seasonal maximum, and the timing of the first summer growth halt. Both atmospheric and soil water stress exerted a strong control on the interannual variability of AWG at the study site, despite its mesic conditions, whilst not affecting carbon inputs. Carbon sink activity, not carbon inputs, determined the interannual variations in wood growth at the study site. Our results provide a functional understanding of the dependence of radial growth on precipitation observed in dendrological studies.},

abstract = {Old-growth forests are often assumed to exhibit no net carbon assimilation over time periods of several years. This generalization has not been typically supported by the few whole-ecosystem, stand-scale eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange in old-growth forests. An eddy-flux tower installed in a {\textgreater}300-year-old hemlock-hardwood forest near the Sylvania Wilderness, Ottawa National Forest, MI, USA, observed a small annual carbon sink of CO2of -72 ± 36 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and -147 ± 42 g C m-2year-1in 2003. This carbon sink was much smaller than carbon sinks of -438 ± 49 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and -490 ± 48 g C m-2year-1in 2003 observed by a nearby flux tower in a 70-year-old mature hardwood forest (Willow Creek, WI). The mature forest had vegetation similar to the old-growth site prior to European settlement. Both sites had slightly larger carbon sinks in 2003, which was a drier and cooler year than 2002. However, the difference in sink strength between the two years was smaller than the uncertainty in the results arising from missing and screened data. Both sites also had significant systematic errors due to non-representative fluxes during certain micrometeorological conditions, which required careful screening. The difference in sink strength between the two sites was driven mainly by greater ER at the old-growth site (965 ± 35 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and 883 ± 69 g C m-2year-1in 2003) compared to the mature site (668 ± 21 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and 703 ± 17 g C m-2year-1in 2003). GEP was lower at the old-growth site (1037 ± 47 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and 1030 ± 41 g C m-2year-1in 2003) compared to the mature site (1106 ± 47 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and 1192 ± 51 g C m-2year-1in 2003), especially in 2003. Observations also suggested that growing season ER had greater interannual variability at the old-growth site. These results imply that old-growth forests in the region may be carbon sinks, though these sinks are smaller than mature forests, mostly likely due to greater ER. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Simulating the magnitude and variability of terrestrial methane sources and sinks poses a challenge to ecosystem models because the biophysical and biogeochemical processes that lead to methane emissions from terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems are, by their nature, episodic and spatially disjunct. As a consequence, model predictions of regional methane emissions based on field campaigns from short eddy covariance towers or static chambers have large uncertainties, because measurements focused on a particular known source of methane emission will be biased compared to regional estimates with regards to magnitude, spatial scale, or frequency of these emissions. Given the relatively large importance of predicting future terrestrial methane fluxes for constraining future atmospheric methane growth rates, a clear need exists to reduce spatiotemporal uncertainties. In 2010, an Ameriflux tower (US-PFa) near Park Falls, WI, USA, was instrumented with closed-path methane flux measurements at 122m above ground in a mixed wetland-upland landscape representative of the Great Lakes region. Two years of flux observations revealed an average annual methane (CH4) efflux of 785±75mgCCH4m-2yr-1, compared to a mean CO2sink of -80gCCO2m-2yr-1, a ratio of 1{\%} in magnitude on a mole basis. Interannual variability in methane flux was 30{\%} of the mean flux and driven by suppression of methane emissions during dry conditions in late summer 2012. Though relatively small, the magnitude of the methane source from the very tall tower measurements was mostly within the range previously measured using static chambers at nearby wetlands, but larger than a simple scaling of those fluxes to the tower footprint. Seasonal patterns in methane fluxes were similar to those simulated in the Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model (DLEM), but magnitude depends on model parameterization and input data, especially regarding wetland extent. The model was unable to simulate short-term (sub-weekly) variability. Temperature was found to be a stronger driver of regional CH4flux than moisture availability or net ecosystem production at the daily to monthly scale. Taken together, these results emphasize the multi-timescale dependence of drivers of regional methane flux and the importance of long, continuous time series for their characterization.},

abstract = {The ability of the DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC) model to predict CO2and water vapour fluxes at the CarboEurope cropland site Oensingen on the Swiss Plateau was tested for the years 2004-2009. DNDC was able to simulate the seasonal trends of CO2and water vapour fluxes quite well. Also the cumulative fluxes for winter wheat, winter barley, winter rapeseed, potato and cover crop were mostly well estimated in comparison with direct eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements. However, some specific problems of DNDC were found. (i) Net CO2uptake was overestimated during winter, when EC measurements indicated C loss; this was probably due to a strong response of assimilation to temperature. (ii) Net CO2uptake was also overestimated for crops sown in autumn; we interpreted these problems as a result of inadequate consideration of the photoperiod of these crops. Being aware of these minor limitations in DNDC, the model was used to predict the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2of 2009 with higher temperature (+2°C and +4°C in yearly mean temperature). The model predicted NEE of -610gCm-2in 2009 under current conditions, -604gCm-2for +2°C and -458gCm-2for +4°C. This was due to a faster development of the main crop (winter wheat). These tests indicated that DNDC could become a valid tool to predict the consequences of climate change on NEE in cropland agroecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Annual mean temperatures increased 1–21 during the period, consistent with the decadal trend across the North American boreal biome.We found that ecosystem carbon exchange responded strongly to air temperature, moisture status, potential evapotranspiration, and summertime solar radiation. The seasonal cycle of ecosystem respiration significantly lagged that of photosynthesis, limited by the rate of soil thaw and the slow drainage of the soil column. Factors acting over long time scales, especially water table depth, strongly influenced the carbon budget on annual time scales. Net uptake was enhanced and respiration inhibited by multiple years of rainfall in excess of evaporative demand. Contrary to expectations, we observed no correlation between longer growing seasons and net uptake, possibly because of offsetting increases in ecosystem respiration. The results indicate that the interactions between soil thaw and water table depth provide critical controls on carbon exchange in boreal forests underlain by peat, on seasonal to decadal time scales, and these factors must be simulated in terrestrial biosphere models to predict response of these regions to future climate.},

abstract = {The eddy covariance method was used for continuous measurement of the seasonal courses of the following parameters of the carbon cycle in a sedge-grass marsh type of wetland ecosystem (49°01′29″N, 14°46′13″E, South Bohemia, Czech Republic, Central Europe): gross ecosystem production (GEP), net ecosystem production (NEP) and ecosystem respiration. During a 3-year series of measurements, we recorded marked fluctuations of the water table, which affected the overall water regime of the wetland studied. Between-year differences in the water regime strongly influenced the total annual carbon sequestration. The lowest annual GEP and NEP of 996 and 152 g m-2 of carbon, respectively, were recorded in 2006, a year with two large floods, one in the spring, the other in the summer. By contrast, in the dry year of 2007, with no flood, the highest annual GEP and NEP were recorded: 1,328 and 274 g m-2, respectively. Significant differences were found in the efficiency of solar energy use for GEP [gross radiation use efficiency, GRUE = GEP/PhAR (photosynthetically active radiation), i.e., amount of carbon gained per energy unit]. The highest GRUE was recorded immediately after the 2006 summer flood. In 2007, the GRUE decreased linearly with rising water table. A variable water regime thus markedly affects the processes of carbon accumulation and the efficiency of solar energy use for organic matter production in freshwater wetlands of the sedge-grass marsh type. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of two contrasting mountain forest types in Switzerland was measured by eddy covariance (EC) measurements at a montane mixed forest, the L{\"{a}}geren forest, over 5 years (2005-2009), and at a subalpine coniferous forest, the Seehornwald in Davos, over 12 years (1997-2009). NEE was validated against annual carbon (C) storage estimates, based on biometric and soil respiration measurements as well as soil C modeling. Three different approaches were used: (1) calculation of net ecosystem production by quantifying C pools and fluxes, (2) assessment of change in wood biomass and soil C storage ($\Delta$C), and (3) application of biomass expansion factors. Although biometric estimates were sensitive to assumptions made for each method applied, they agreed well with measured NEE. Comparing 5 years of EC measurements available at both sites during 2005 and 2009 revealed that NEE, gross primary production (GPP), and total ecosystem respiration (TER) were larger at the L{\"{a}}geren forest compared to the Davos forest, whereas soil respiration and soil C sequestration were of similar magnitudes. Both sites showed similar annual trends for NEE, GPP and TER, but different seasonal courses, due to different responses to environmental conditions (temperature, soil moisture, and radiation). Differences in the magnitude as well as in the seasonality of ecosystem CO 2 exchange could mainly be attributed to tree phenology, productivity, and carbon allocation patterns, which are combined effects of tree type (broad-leaved vs. coniferous trees) and site-specific climatic conditions. Flux differences between the two mountain sites highlight the importance of considering the role of altitude in ecological studies and modeling.},

Two eddy covariance systems were used to simultaneously measure water vapour and ozone fluxes above and below a canopy of Holm Oak (Quercus ilex). Additional measurements of environmental parameters allowed to calculate stomatal ozone fluxes in order to parameterize atmospheric models and new algorithms for discriminating ozone deposition into its three more significant sinks: soil, stomata, and cuticles. Results showed that stomata explained almost the totality of ozone fluxes during the winter season, and {\textless}60{\%} during the warm seasons under condition of drought stress. Soils removed up to 30{\%} of ozone, suggesting the importance of this sink in this forest ecosystem. This study spanning all seasons over a 2-year period advanced our understanding about the contribution of a representative Mediterranean Oak forest to biosphere-atmosphere exchange.},

abstract = {We studied a semi-natural forest in Northern Italy that was set aside more than 50 years ago, in order to better understand the soil carbon cycle and in particular the partitioning of soil respiration between autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. Here we report on soil organic carbon, root density, and estimates of annual fluxes of soil CO2as measured with a mobile chamber system at 16 permanent collars about monthly during the course of a year. We partitioned between autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration by the indirect regression method, which enabled us to obtain the seasonal pattern of single components. The soil pool of organic carbon, with 15.8 (±4.5)kgm-2, was very high over the entire depth of 45cm. The annual respiration rates ranged from 0.6 to 6.9$\mu$molCO2m-2s-1with an average value of 3.4 (±2.3)$\mu$molCO2m-2s-1, and a cumulative flux of 1.1kgCm-2yr-1. The heterotrophic component accounted for 66{\%} of annual CO2efflux. Soil temperature largely controlled the heterotrophic respiration (R2=0.93), while the autotrophic component followed irradiation, pointing to the role of photosynthesis in modulating the annual course of soil respiration. Most studies on soil respiration partitioning indicate autotrophic root respiration as a first control of the spatial variability of the overall respiration, which originates mainly from the uppermost soil layers. Instead, in our forest the spatial variability of soil respiration was mainly linked to soil carbon, and deeper layers seemed to provide a significant contribution to soil respiration, a feature that may be typical for an undisturbed, naturally maturing ecosystem with well developed pedobiological processes and high carbon stocks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {Climate, vegetation cover, and management create finescale heterogeneity in unirrigated agricultural regions, with important but not well-quantified consequences for spatial and temporal variations in surface CO2, water, and heat fluxes. Eddy covariance fluxes were measured in seven agricultural fields-comprising winter wheat, pasture, and sorghum - in the U.S. Southern Great Plains (SGP) during the 2001 - 03 growing seasons. Land cover was the dominant source of variation in surface fluxes, with 50{\%}-100{\%} differences between fields planted in winter - spring versus fields planted in summer. Interannual variation was driven mainly by precipitation, which varied more than twofold between years. Peak aboveground biomass and growing season net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 increased in rough proportion to precipitation. Based on a partitioning of gross fluxes with a regression model, ecosystem respiration increased linearly with gross primary production, but with an offset that increased near the time of seed production. Because the regression model was designed for well-watered periods, it successfully retrieved NEE and ecosystem parameters during the peak growing season and identified periods of moisture limitation during the summer. In summary, the effects of crop type, land management, and water limitation on carbon, water, and energy fluxes were large. Capturing the controlling factors in landscape-scale models will be necessary to estimate the ecological feedbacks to climate and other environmental impacts associated with changing human needs for agricultural production of food, fiber, and energy.},

abstract = {Disturbances are increasing globally due to anthropogenic changes in land use and climate. This study determines whether a disturbance that affects the physiology of individual trees can be used to predict the response of the ecosystem by weighing two competing hypothesis at annual time scales: (a) changes in ecosystem fluxes are proportional to observable patterns of mortality or (b) to explain ecosystem fluxes the physiology of dying trees must also be incorporated. We evaluate these hypotheses by analyzing 6 years of eddy covariance flux data collected throughout the progression of a spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis) epidemic in a Wyoming Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii)–subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forest and testing for changes in canopy conductance (gc), evapotranspiration (ET), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2. We predict from these hypotheses that (a) gc, ET, and NEE all diminish (decrease in absolute magnitude) as trees die or (b) that (1) gc and ET decline as trees are attacked (hydraulic failure from beetle-associated blue-stain fungi) and (2) NEE diminishes both as trees are attacked (restricted gas exchange) and when they die. Ecosystem fluxes declined as the outbreak progressed and the epidemic was best described as two phases: (I) hydraulic failure caused restricted gc, ET (28 ± 4{\%} decline, Bayesian posterior mean ± standard deviation), and gas exchange (NEE diminished 13 ± 6{\%}) and (II) trees died (NEE diminished 51 ± 3{\%} with minimal further change in ET to 36 ± 4{\%}). These results support hypothesis b and suggest that model predictions of ecosystem fluxes following massive disturbances must be modified to account for changes in tree physiological controls and not simply observed mortality.},

An earlier snowmelt of more than one month caused a considerable advancement (40 days) of the beginning of the carbon uptake period (CUP) and, together with a delayed establishment of the snow season in autumn, contributed to a two-month longer CUP. The combined effect of the shorter snow season and the extended CUP led to an increase of about 100{\%} in annual carbon net uptake. Nevertheless, the unusual environmental conditions imposed by the early snowmelt led to changes in canopy structure and functioning, with a reduction of the carbon sequestration rate during the snow-free period},

abstract = {The estimation of the carbon balance in ecosystems, regions, and the biosphere is currently one of the main concerns in the study of the ecology of global change. Current remote sensing methodologies for estimating gross primary productivity are not satisfactory because they rely too heavily on (i) the availability of climatic data, (ii) the definition of land-use cover, and (iii) the assumptions of the effects of these two factors on the radiation-use efficiency of vegetation (RUE). A new methodology is urgently needed that will actually assess RUE and overcome the problems associated with the capture of fluctuations in carbon absorption in space and over time. Remote sensing techniques such as the widely used reflectance vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI, EVI) allow green plant biomass and therefore plant photosynthetic capacity to be assessed. However, there are vegetation types, such as the Mediterranean forests, with a very low seasonality of these vegetation indices and a high seasonality of carbon uptake. In these cases it is important to detect how much of this capacity is actually realized, which is a much more challenging goal. The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) derived from freely available satellite information (MODIS sensor) presented for a 5-year analysis for a Mediterranean forest a positive relationship with the RUE. Thus, we show that it is possible to estimate RUE and GPP in real time and therefore actual carbon uptake of Mediterranean forests at ecosystem level using the PRI. This conceptual and technological advancement would avoid the need to rely on the sometimes unreliable maximum RUE.},

abstract = {Carbon (C) cycling in the boreal forest is driven by both natural and human disturbances, but there is little information on the impact of forest management practices on ecosystem-level C balance. We evaluated the C balance of a recently harvested boreal site in eastern Canada by measuring CO2fluxes with the eddy covariance technique for 1 year before the application of a scarification treatment (mechanical site preparation) and for 1 year after the treatment was applied to approximately 40{\%} of the study area. Net annual exchange indicated a source of 111 g C m-2year-1before scarification that increased to 175 g C m-2year-1after treatment. Annual gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and net C flux varied between years, but there was no significant difference for ecosystem respiration. Since the differences in climate between years did not explain the changes in the site C balance and daytime net C sequestration under non-limiting environmental conditions was generally lower after the treatment, the large difference in C emissions was most likely due to decreased GEP resulting from the destruction of approximately 60{\%} of the living aboveground vegetation within the scarified areas. Although daily NEP was almost always negative throughout the year, a net daily C sink was observed during a 2-week period in late summer 2003 when air temperatures were approximately 8 °C cooler than preceding weeks. An analysis of the residuals from light-response regressions showed that soil water content and vapor pressure deficit were the second most important variables explaining morning and afternoon net C flux in 2003 and 2004, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fluxes of CO2, water vapor, and sensible heat were measured by the eddy covariance method above a young ponderosa pine plantation in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (CA) over two growing seasons (1 June-10 September 1997 and 1 May-30 October 1998). The Mediterranean-type climate of California is characterized by a protracted summer drought, with precipitation occurring mainly from October through May. While drought stress increased continuously over both summer growing seasons, 1998 was wetter and cooler than average due to EL Nino climate patterns and 1997 was hotter and drier than average. One extreme 3-day heat wave in 1997 (Days 218-221) caused a step change in the relationship between H2O flux and vapor pressure deficit, resulting in a change in canopy conductance, possibly due to cavitation of the tree xylem. This step change was also correlated with decreased rates of C sequestration and evapotranspiration; we estimate that this extreme climatic event decreased gross ecosystem production (GEP) by roughly 20{\%} (4 $\mu$mol C m-2s-1) for the rest of the growing season. In contrast, a cooler, wetter spring in 1998 delayed the onset of photosynthesis by about 3 weeks, resulting in roughly 20{\%} lower GEP relative to the spring of 1997. We conclude that the net C balance of Mediterranean-climate pine ecosystems is sensitive to extreme events under low soil moisture conditions and could be altered by slight changes in the climate or hydrologic regime.

abstract = {Carbon (C) uptake rates in many forests are sustained, or decline only briefly, following disturbances that partially defoliate the canopy. The mechanisms supporting such functional resistance to moderate forest disturbance are largely unknown. We used a large scale experiment, in which {\textgreater}6700 Populus (aspen) and Betula (birch) trees were stem-girdled within a 39-ha area, to identify mechanisms sustaining C uptake through partial canopy defoliation. The Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment in northern Michigan, USA, employs a suite of C-cycling measurements within paired treatment and control meteorolog ical flux tower footprints. We found that enhancement of canopy light-use efficiency and maintenance of light absorption maintained net ecosystem production (NEP) and aboveground wood net primary production (NPP) when leaf-area index (LAI) of the treatment forest temporarily declined by nearly half its maximum value. In the year following peak defoliation, redistribution of nitrogen (N) in the treatment forest from senescent early successional aspen and birch to non-girdled later successional species facilitated the recovery of total LAI to pre-disturbance levels. Sustained canopy physiological competency following disturbance coincided with a downward shift in maximum canopy height, indicating that compensatory photosynthetic C uptake by undisturbed, later successional subdominant and subcanopy vegetation supported C-uptake resistance to disturbance. These findings have implications for ecosystem management and modeling, demonstrating that forests may tolerate considerable leaf-area losses without diminishing rates of C uptake. We conclude that the resistance of C uptake to moderate disturbance depends not only on replacement of lost leaf area, but also on rapid compensatory photosynthetic C uptake during defoliation by emerging later successional species.},

We used MODIS imagery to establish that the tower sites were representative of the patterns of secondary succession in the region, and Landsat images to show that the individual stands have changed over the last 22 years in ways that match the spatially derived trends. The eddy covariance towers were well matched, with similar equipment and programs, which maximized site-to-site precision and allowed us to operate the network in an efficient manner. The six oldest sites were fully operational for ∼90{\%} of the growing season and ∼70{\%} of the dormant season from 2001 or 2002 to 2004, with most of the missing data caused by low battery charge or bad signals from the sonic anemometers. The rates of midday growing-season CO2 uptake recovered to preburn levels within 4 years of fire. The seasonality of land–atmosphere exchange and growing-season length changed markedly with stand age. The foliage in the younger stands (1989, 1998, and 2003 burns) was almost entirely deciduous, which resulted in comparatively short growing seasons that lasted ∼65 days. In contrast, the older stands (1850, 1930, 1964, and 1981) were mostly evergreen, which resulted in comparatively long growing seasons that lasted ∼130 days.

abstract = {At Tharandt/Germany eddy covariance (EC) measurements of carbon dioxide and heat fluxes are performed above an old spruce forest since 1996. The last ten years cover almost all meteorological extremes observed during the last 45 years: the coldest and warmest year with mean air temperature of 6.1 degrees C (1996) and 9.6.degrees C (2000) as well as the fourth wettest and the driest year with a precipitation of 1098 mm (2002) and 501 mm (2003), respectively. In general, the observed annual carbon net ecosystem exchange (NEE) indicates a high net sink from - 395 g C m(-2) a(-1) (2003) to - 698 g C m(-2) a(-1) (1999) with a coefficient of variation c(v) = 16.6{\%}. The yearly evapotranspiration (ET) has a lower interannual variability (c(v) = 9.5{\%}) between 389 mm (2003) and 537 mm (2000). The influence of flux correction and gap filling on the amount of annual NEE and ET is considerable. Using different methods of gap filling (non-linear regressions, mean diurnal courses) yields annual NEE totals that differ by up to 18{\%}. Consistency analysis regarding energy balance closure, comparisons with independent soil respiration and biomass increment measurements indicate reliability of the fluxes. The average gap of the energy balance is 15{\%} of the available energy based on regression slope with an intercept of 3 to 16 W m(-2), but around zero for annual flux ratios. Between 47{\%} and 63{\%} of the net ecosystem productivity was fixed above ground according to up- scaled tree ring data and forest inventories, respectively. Chamber measurements of soil respiration yield up to 90{\%} of nighttime EC based total ecosystem respiration. Thus, we conclude that the EC based flux represents an upper limit of the C sink at the site.},

abstract = {Eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange were made above a temperate mixed forest for 16 months in northeastern China. The stand is a natural grown, unmanaged mixture of deciduous broad-leaved and coniferous forest and the trees cover a wide range of age classes with a maximum about 450 years. The objective of this study was to test the traditional hypothesis that forests at a late stage of development are insignificant carbon sinks. CO2exchanges of the ecosystem were studied under conditions of adequate soil water supply. The main results are that:(1)Ecosystem respiration and its components, including soil, stem and leaf respiration, all fit exponential correlations with soil or air temperature, but the ratios of these components to total ecosystem respiration varied during the year. When temperature rose, the ratio of soil respiration to total respiration was relatively stable, while that of leaf and stem respiration increased and decreased, respectively. Soil respiration was the biggest component (48{\%} of the whole ecosystem respiration on average, without including the respiration of fallen trees and coarse woody debris). Leaf respiration was the second largest (22-40{\%}) and stem respiration was the least (13-29{\%}).(2)The ecosystem has very large assimilation potential as environmental factors are adequate in growing season, but the actual gross ecosystem exchange (Gee) was only about 45{\%} of the potential due to the influence of water vapor pressure deficit (VPD). High VPD reduced the photosynthetic capacity and the highest relative reductions occurred in afternoon when VPD was higher, with relative reductions between 0.3 and 0.6 during this time. Bigger reduction occurred in May and July, corresponding the 2 months when VPD are higher.(3)Respiration (Re) and net ecosystem exchange (Nee) were about 74{\%} and 26{\%} of actual Geeduring growing season. Net assimilation began in the middle of April and ended in early September. The largest uptake occurred in June, then July and August. Large net CO2losses occurred in late September and October because of relatively high temperature and leaf fall from most trees in the forest.(4)This forest was a carbon sink of 169-187 g C m-2yr-1over a 12-month-period commencing August 2002. Application of the u* correction decreased the annual uptake of carbon by 24.6 g C m-2on average, corresponding to 13.5{\%} of the corrected annual Nee. There are many uncertainties for determination of absolute values of long-term net carbon exchange even in sites with ideal topography using Eddy-covariance. More detailed experiments and related theoretical studies are needed in the future. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta in California was drained and converted to agriculture more than a century ago, and since then has experienced extreme rates of soil subsidence from peat oxidation. To reverse subsidence and capture carbon there is increasing interest in converting drained agricultural land-use types to flooded conditions. Rice agriculture is proposed as a flooded land-use type with CO2sequestration potential for this region. We conducted two years of simultaneous eddy covariance measurements at a conventional drained and grazed degraded peatland and a newly converted rice paddy to evaluate the impact of drained to flooded land-use change on CO2, CH4, and evaporation fluxes.We found that the grazed degraded peatland emitted 175-299g-Cm-2yr-1as CO2and 3.3g-Cm-2yr-1as CH4, while the rice paddy sequestered 84-283g-Cm-2yr-1of CO2from the atmosphere and released 2.5-6.6g-Cm-2yr-1as CH4. The rice paddy evaporated 45-95{\%} more water than the grazed degraded peatland. Annual photosynthesis was similar between sites, but flooding at the rice paddy inhibited ecosystem respiration, making it a net CO2sink. The rice paddy had reduced rates of soil subsidence due to oxidation compared with the drained peatland, but did not completely reverse subsidence. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Forest ecosystems play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by sequestering a considerable fraction of anthropogenic CO2, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation. However, there is a gap in our understanding about the carbon dynamics of eucalypt (broadleaf evergreen) forests in temperate climates, which might differ from temperate evergreen coniferous or deciduous broadleaved forests given their fundamental differences in physiology, phenology and growth dynamics. To address this gap we undertook a 3-year study (2010–2012) of eddy covariance measurements in a dry temperate eucalypt forest in southeastern Australia. We determined the annual net carbon balance and investigated the temporal (seasonal and inter-annual) variability in and environmental controls of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE), gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER). The forest was a large and constant carbon sink throughout the study period, even in winter, with an overall mean NEE of −1234 ± 109 (SE) g C m−2 yr−1. Estimated annual ER was similar for 2010 and 2011 but decreased in 2012 ranging from 1603 to 1346 g C m−2 yr−1, whereas GPP showed no significant inter-annual variability, with a mean annual estimate of 2728 ± 39 g C m−2 yr−1. All ecosystem carbon fluxes had a pronounced seasonality, with GPP being greatest during spring and summer and ER being highest during summer, whereas peaks in NEE occurred in early spring and again in summer. High NEE in spring was likely caused by a delayed increase in ER due to low temperatures. A strong seasonal pattern in environmental controls of daytime and night-time NEE was revealed. Daytime NEE was equally explained by incoming solar radiation and air temperature, whereas air temperature was the main environmental driver of night-time NEE. The forest experienced unusual above-average annual rainfall during the first 2 years of this 3-year period so that soil water content remained relatively high and the forest was not water limited. Our results show the potential of temperate eucalypt forests to sequester large amounts of carbon when not water limited. However, further studies using bottom-up approaches are needed to validate measurements from the eddy covariance flux tower and to account for a possible underestimation in ER due to advection fluxes.},

abstract = {This study compares the CO2 exchange of a natural bog forest, and of a bog drained for forestry in the pre-Alpine region of southern Germany. The sites are separated by only 10 km, they share the same soil formation history and are exposed to the same climate and weather conditions. In contrast, they differ in land use history: at the Schechenfilz site a natural bog-pine forest (Pinus mugo ssp. rotundata) grows on an undisturbed, about 5m thick peat layer; at Mooseurach a planted spruce forest (Picea abies) grows on drained and degraded peat (3.4 m). The net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) at both sites has been investigated for 2 years (July 2010-June 2012), using the eddy covariance technique. Our results indicate that the drained, forested bog at Mooseurach is a much stronger carbon dioxide sink (-130 +/- 31 and -300 +/- 66 g C m(-2) a(-1) in the first and second year, respectively) than the natural bog forest at Schechenfilz (-53 +/- 28 and -73 +/- 38 g C m(-2) a(-1)). The strong net CO2 uptake can be explained by the high gross primary productivity of the 44-year old spruces that overcompensates the two-times stronger ecosystem respiration at the drained site. The larger productivity of the spruces can be clearly attributed to the larger plant area index (PAI) of the spruce site. However, even though current flux measurements indicate strong CO2 uptake of the drained spruce forest, the site is a strong net CO2 source when the whole life-cycle since forest planting is considered. It is important to access this result in terms of the long-term biome balance. To do so, we used historical data to estimate the difference between carbon fixation by the spruces and the carbon loss from the peat due to drainage since forest planting. This rough estimate indicates a strong carbon release of +134 t C ha(-1) within the last 44 years. Thus, the spruces would need to grow for another 100 years at about the current rate, to compensate the potential peat loss of the former years. In contrast, the natural bog-pine ecosystem has likely been a small but stable carbon sink for decades, which our results suggest is very robust regarding short-term changes of environmental factors.},

abstract = {Forests in Mediterranean Europe are located in a hot spot for tropospheric ozone formation. We applied two canopy-level stomatal conductance models (Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models) to two Mediterranean evergreen forests (Umbrella pine at San Rossore, and Holm oak at Castelporziano, in central Italy), which is essential for assessing ozone impact on forests via the stomatal flux-based approach. Parameterizations of the models was carried out by the Eddy Covariance technique. Both Jarvis-type and Ball-Woodrow-Berry models well explained the observed stomatal conductance and stomatal ozone flux in both forests. Maximum stomatal conductance was 72{\%} higher in Umbrella pine than in Holm oak, leading to higher stomatal ozone flux. Inclusion of a soil water function improved the performance of the Jarvis-type model for the estimation of stomatal ozone flux. We found contrasting results concerning the coefficient m (the slope of the photosynthesis-stomatal conductance relationship) in the Ball-Woodrow-Berry model between the two forests: while m was constant for varying soil water status in the Holm oak forest, it declined with soil drying in the Umbrella pine forest. This may result from higher stomatal sensitivity to drought in Umbrella pine as a response to avoid drought stress. Overall, these results advance our understanding of ozone risk assessment in Mediterranean forests.},

abstract = {Savanna landscapes across north Australia are characterised by limited topographic variation, and in the Northern Territory, by a relatively constant decline in rainfall with distance inland. The North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT) traverses this 1000km gradient of largely intact vegetation which provides an ideal 'living laboratory' and framework to investigate the influence of vegetation structural and floristic change and climate drivers on land-atmosphere exchange at a regional scale. We conducted a multidisciplinary program examining carbon, water and energy fluxes as a function of climate and vegetation change along a sub-continental environmental gradient. Initial findings are reported in this Special Issue. During the program, an intensive field campaign was undertaken during the dry season to characterise vegetation and soil properties of eight flux tower sites used to describe spatial and temporal dynamics of fluxes across this gradient. This paper provides an overview of the savanna landscapes of north Australia detailing vegetation structural and physiological change along this gradient. Above-ground woody biomass, stem density, overstorey LAI and canopy height declined along sites that spanned an 1100mm annual rainfall gradient. Biomass ranged from 35 to 5t C ha-1with dry season LAI ranging from {\~{}}1 to 0.05 across savanna sites both intact and cleared for grazing. Across open-forest and woodland savanna, basal area ranged from 9.7 to 5.3m2ha-1. While structural change was significant and correlated with rainfall, leaf scale physiological properties (maximal photosynthesis, Vcmax, ci/ca, light use efficiency) of the dominant woody species showed little variation, despite the significant environmental gradient. It is likely that changes in structural properties dominate spatial patterns of flux as opposed to physiological plasticity or species differences along this gradient. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {As forests age, their structure and productivity change, yet in some cases, annual rates of water loss remain unchanged. To identify mechanisms that might explain such observations, and to determine if widely different age classes of forests differ functionally, we examined young (Y, approximately 25 years), mature (M, approximately 90 years) and old (O, approximately 250 years) ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex P. Laws.) stands growing in a drought-prone region of central Oregon. Although the stands differed in tree leaf area index (LAIT) (Y = 0.9, M = 2.8, O = 2.1), cumulative tree transpiration measured by sap flow did not differ substantially during the growing season (100-112 mm). Yet when water was readily available, transpiration per unit leaf area of the youngest trees was about three times that of M trees and five times that of O trees. These patterns resulted from a nearly sixfold difference in leaf specific conductance (KL) between the youngest and oldest trees. At the time of maximum transpiration in the Y stand in May-June, gross carbon uptake (gross ecosystem production, GEP) was similar for Y and O stands despite an almost twofold difference in stand leaf area index (LAIS). However, the higher rate of water use by Y trees was not sustainable in the drought-prone environment, and between spring and late summer, KL of Y trees declined fivefold compared with a nearly twofold decline for M trees and a {\textless} 30{\%} reduction in O trees. Because the Y stand contained a significant shrub understory and more exposed soil, there was no appreciable difference in mean daily latent energy fluxes between the Y stand and the older stands as measured by the eddy-covariance technique. These patterns resulted in 60 to 85{\%} higher seasonal GEP and 55 to 65{\%} higher water-use efficiency at the M and O stands compared with the Y stand.},

abstract = {Abstract Forest fire dramatically affects the carbon storage and underlying mechanisms that control the carbon balance of recovering ecosystems. In western North America where fire extent has increased in recent years, we measured carbon pools and fluxes in moderately and severely burned forest stands 2 years after a fire to determine the controls on net ecosystem productivity (NEP) and make comparisons with unburned stands in the same region. Total ecosystem carbon in soil and live and dead pools in the burned stands was on average 66{\%} that of unburned stands (11.0 and 16.5 kg C m-2, respectively, P{\textless}0.01). Soil carbon accounted for 56{\%} and 43{\%} of the carbon pools in burned and unburned stands. NEP was significantly lower in severely burned compared with unburned stands (P{\textless}0.01) with an increasing trend from -125+-44 g C m-2 yr-1 (+-1 SD) in severely burned stands (stand replacing fire), to -38+-96 and +50+-47 g C m-2 yr-1 in moderately burned and unburned stands, respectively. Fire of moderate severity killed 82{\%} of trees {\textless}20 cm in diameter (diameter at 1.3 m height, DBH); however, this size class only contributed 22{\%} of prefire estimates of bole wood production. Larger trees ({\textgreater} 20 cm DBH) suffered only 34{\%} mortality under moderate severity fire and contributed to 91{\%} of postfire bole wood production. Growth rates of trees that survived the fire were comparable with their prefire rates. Net primary production NPP (g C m-2 yr-1, +-1 SD) of severely burned stands was 47{\%} of unburned stands (167+-76, 346+-148, respectively, P{\textless}0.05), with forb and grass aboveground NPP accounting for 74{\%} and 4{\%} of total aboveground NPP, respectively. Based on continuous seasonal measurements of soil respiration in a severely burned stand, in areas kept free of ground vegetation, soil heterotrophic respiration accounted for 56{\%} of total soil CO2 efflux, comparable with the values of 54{\%} and 49{\%} previously reported for two of the unburned forest stands. Estimates of total ecosystem heterotrophic respiration (Rh) were not significantly different between stand types 2 years after fire. The ratio NPP/Rh averaged 0.55, 0.85 and 1.21 in the severely burned, moderately burned and unburned stands, respectively. Annual soil CO2 efflux was linearly related to aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) with an increase in soil CO2 efflux of 1.48 g C yr-1 for every 1 g increase in ANPP (P{\textless}0.01, r2 = 0.76). There was no significant difference in this relationship between the recently burned and unburned stands. Contrary to expectations that the magnitude of NEP 2 years postfire would be principally driven by the sudden increase in detrital pools and increased rates of Rh, the data suggest NPP was more important in determining postfire NEP.},

abstract = {We examined a 6-year record of automated chamber-based soil CO2 efflux (F-s) and the underlying processes in relation to climate and canopy gas exchange at an AmeriFlux site in a seasonally drought-stressed pine forest. Interannual variability of F-s was large (CV=17{\%}) with a range of 427 g C m(-2) yr(-1) around a mean annual F-s of 811 g C m(-2) yr(-1). On average, 76{\%} of the variation of daily mean F-s could be quantified using an empirical model with year-specific basal respiration rate that was a linear function of tree basal area increment (BAI) and modulated by a common response to soil temperature and moisture. Interannual variability in F-s could be attributed almost equally to interannual variability in BAI (a proxy for above-ground productivity) and interannual variability in soil climate. Seasonal total F-s was twice as sensitive to soil moisture variability during the summer months compared with temperature variability during the same period and almost insensitive to the natural range of interannual variability in spring temperatures. A strong seasonality in both root respiration (R-r) and heterotrophic respiration (R-h) was observed with the fraction attributed to R-r steadily increasing from 18{\%} in mid-March to 50{\%} in early June through early July before dropping rapidly to 10{\%} of F-s by mid-August. The seasonal pattern in R-r (10-day averages) was strongly linearly correlated with tree transpiration (r(2)=0.90, P {\textless} 0.01) as measured using sap flux techniques and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP, r(2)=0.83, P {\textless} 0.01) measured by the eddy-covariance approach. R-r increased by 0.43 g C m(-2) day(-1) for every 1 g C m(-2) day(-1) increase in GEP. The strong linear correlation of R-r to seasonal changes in GEP and transpiration combined with longer-term interannual variability in the base rate of F-s, as a linear function of BAI (r(2)=0.64, P=0.06), provides compelling justification for including canopy processes in future models of F-s.},

abstract = {An intercomparison is made of the Net Ecosystem Exchange of CO2, NEE, for eight Dutch grassland sites: four natural grasslands, two production grasslands and two meteorological stations within a rotational grassland region. At all sites the NEE was determined during at least 10 months per site, using the eddy-covariance (EC) technique, but in different years. The NEE does not include any import or export other than CO2. The photosynthesis-light response analysis technique is used along with the respiration-temperature response technique to partition NEE into Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (R-e) and to obtain the eco-physiological characteristics of the sites at the field scale. Annual sums of NEE, GPPand R-e are then estimated using the fitted response curves with observed radiation and air temperature from a meteorological site in the centre of The Netherlands as drivers. These calculations are carried out for four years (2002-2005). Land use and management histories are not considered. The estimated annual R-e for all individual sites is more or less constant per site and the average for all sites amounts to 1390 30 gC m(-2) a(-1). The narrow uncertainty band (+/- 2{\%}) reflects the small differences in the mean annual air temperature. The mean annual GPP was estimated to be 1325 g C m(-2) a(-1), and displays a much higher standard deviation, of 110 gC m(-2) a(-1) (8{\%}), which reflects the relatively large variation in annual solar radiation. The mean annual NEE amounts to -65 85 gC m(-2) a(-1). From two sites, four-year records of CO2 flux were available and analyzed (2002-2005). Using the weather record of 2005 with optimizations from the other years, the standard deviation of annual GPP was estimated to be 171-206 gC m(-2) a(-1) (8-14{\%}), of annual R-e 227-247 gC m(-2) a(-1)(14-16{\%}) and of annual NEE 176-276 gC m(-2) a(-1). The inter-site standard deviation was higher for GPP and R-e, 534 gC m(-2) a(-1) (37.3{\%}) and 486 gC m(-2) a(-1) (34.8{\%}), respectively. However, the inter-site standard deviation of NEE was similar to the interannual one, amounting to 207 gC m-2a-1. Large differences occur due to soil type. The grasslands on organic (peat) soils show a mean net release of CO2 of 220 90 g C m(-2) a(-1) while the grasslands on mineral (clay and sand) soils show a mean net uptake of CO2 of 90 90 g C m(-2) a(-1). If a weighing with the fraction of grassland on organic (20{\%}) and mineral soils (80{\%}) is applied, an average NEE of 28 90 g C m(-2) a(-1) is found. The results from the analysis illustrate the need for regionally specific and spatially explicit CO2 emission estimates from grassland.},

@article{Jammet_2015,
abstract = {The ice-cover season and subsequent spring thaw are thought to be of particular importance for the biogeochemical cycle of northern lakes and wetlands. Yet the magnitude of their methane emissions during an entire cold season is uncertain due to scarce measurements. While wetlands are known to be the highest natural emitters of methane, emissions from northern lakes are an uncertain component of terrestrial carbon budgets. To evaluate the importance of methane emissions from a subarctic lake during winter and spring, surface methane fluxes were recorded with the eddy covariance method in a subarctic fen-type wetland and in an adjacent shallow lake, from freezeup to complete ice out. The fen was a steady emitter of methane throughout winter. While no detectable flux was observed from the ice-covered lake surface during winter, it was the largest methane source of the landscape in spring, with a cumulative release 1.7-fold higher than at the fen, accounting for 53{\%} of annual lake emissions. The high temporal resolution of the measurements allowed making a direct link between breakdown of the temperature stratification after ice breakup and the highest release of methane from the lake surface. A sediment upwelling at the end of the thaw season likely contributed to these emissions. We suggest that, unlike wetlands, shallow seasonally ice-covered lakes can have their highest methane emission potential in the cold season, likely dominating the spring methane release of subarctic landscapes with high lake coverage.},

@article{KATO_2006,
abstract = {Three years of eddy covariance measurements were used to characterize the seasonal and interannual variability of the CO2 fluxes above an alpine meadow (3250 m a.s.l.) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. This alpine meadow was a weak sink for atmospheric CO2, with a net ecosystem production (NEP) of 78.5, 91.7, and 192.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. The prominent, high NEP in 2004 resulted from the combination of high gross primary production (GPP) and low ecosystem respiration (R-e) during the growing season. The period of net absorption of CO2 in 2004, 179 days, was 10 days longer than that in 2002 and 5 days longer than that in 2003. Moreover, the date on which the mean air temperature first exceeded 5.0 degrees C was 10 days earlier in 2004 (DOY110) than in 2002 or 2003. This date agrees well with that on which the green aboveground biomass (Green AGB) started to increase. The relationship between light-use efficiency and Green AGB was similar among the three years. In 2002, however, earlier senescence possibly caused low autumn GPP, and thus the annual NEP, to be lower. The low summertime R-e in 2004 was apparently caused by lower soil temperatures and the relatively lower temperature dependence of R-e in comparison with the other years. These results suggest that (1) the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau plays a potentially significant role in global carbon sequestration, because alpine meadow covers about one-third of this vast plateau, and (2) the annual NEP in the alpine meadow was comprehensively controlled by the temperature environment, including its effect on biomass growth.},

abstract = {Old growth forests have traditionally been viewed as an insignificant sink or source in the global carbon cycle and therefore, flux tower studies of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and evapotranspiration (LE) using flux measurements in these ecosystems are limited. Here we report eddy covariance (EC) fluxes of carbon dioxide and water above and below the canopy of an old growth Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans) forest over an 18month period. Mountain Ash species are the world's tallest angiosperm and recognized as the most carbon-dense forests, which potentially makes them an important component of the terrestrial carbon and water budgets in Australia. Results showed that for 2006, the ecosystem was a large net sink of carbon of 377±49gCm-2year-1. Throughout the study period, daytime Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) was limited mainly by radiation, but there were important secondary drivers regulating carbon uptake, especially in summer, when atmospheric and soil water deficits were high. The highest rates of NEE occurred during spring, when the ecosystem was not limited by radiation or moisture, and the lowest rates were observed during autumn and winter. In 2006, GPP for the ecosystem was 2615gCm-2year-1, and ecosystem respiration (Re) was 2238gCm-2year-1. During the summer and autumn of 2006, the understorey fluxes accounted for 29{\%} of ecosystem GPP, 33{\%} of evapotranspiration, and 53{\%} of night time Re, a significant proportion of carbon dioxide and water exchange given that the understorey biomass is only one tenth of the ecosystem biomass. Results from this study highlighted the importance of the understorey vegetation in regulating old growth forest carbon and water balances, which has important implications for forest management practices. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In 2001-03, continuous eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) flux were made above mature boreal aspen, black spruce, and jack pine forests in Saskatchewan, Canada, prior to and during a 3-year drought. During the 1st drought year, ecosystem respiration (R) was reduced at the aspen site due to the drying of surface soil layers. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) increased as a result of a warm spring and a slow decrease of deep soil moisture. These conditions resulted in the highest annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP) in the 9 years of flux measurements at this site. During 2002 and 2003, a reduction of 6{\%} and 34{\%} in NEP, respectively, compared to 2000 was observed as the result of reductions in both R and GEP, indicating a conservative response to the drought. Although the drought affected most of western Canada, there was considerable spatial variability in summer rainfall over the 100-km extent of the study area; summer rainfalls in 2001 and 2002 at the two conifer sites minimized the impact of the drought. In 2003, however, precipitation was similarly low at all three sites. Due to low topographic position and consequent poor drainage at the black spruce site and the coarse soil with low water-holding capacity at the jack pine site almost no reduction in R, GEP, and NEP was observed at these two sites. This study shows that the impact of drought on carbon sequestration by boreal forest ecosystems strongly depends on rainfall distribution, soil characteristics, topography, and the presence of vegetation that is well adapted to these conditions.},

abstract = {Unmanaged forests at a late stage of successional development are considered to be insignificant as carbon sinks, since in theory, assimilation is thought to be balanced by respiration. However, little experimental evidence for this hypothesis exists so far for forests at the ecosystem level. Therefore, we performed continuous eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide over an unmanaged beech forest in the Hainich National Park in Central Germany as part of the EU project CARBOEUROFLUX. This forest shows typical characteristics of an 'advanced' forest with large dead wood pools, a diverse stand structure and a wide tree age class distribution, up to 250 years. This forest was a large carbon sink over 2 years, with 494 g C m-2per year in 2000 and 490 g C m-2per year in 2001. Daytime summer fluxes were strongly controlled by photosynthetic photon flux density (R2= 0.7-0.9), with minor effects of the ratio of diffuse to total downward radiation or the vapor pressure deficit. Nighttime CO2fluxes were mainly controlled by soil temperature (R2= 0.8) and soil moisture. In addition, high nighttime CO2fluxes (4-6 $\mu$mol m-2s-1) were found directly before and during bud break in spring as well as just after leaf fall of both years (2000 and 2001), reflecting stand physiology corresponding to phenological changes, independent of soil temperature. Additional wind profile measurements at five heights within the canopy revealed a decoupling of above and below canopy air flow under conditions of low friction velocity (u* {\textless} 0.4 m s-1), probably indicating down slope drainage. In conclusion, unmanaged forests at a comparatively late stage of successional development can still act as significant carbon sinks with large implications for forest management practice and negotiations about biological sinks within the Kyoto Protocol. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {We built an automatic chamber system to measure greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange in forested peatland ecosystems. We aimed to build a system robust enough which would work throughout the year and could measure through a changing snowpack in addition to producing annual GHG fluxes by integrating the measurements without the need of using models. The system worked rather well throughout the year, but it was not service free. Gap filling of data was still necessary. We observed problems in carbon dioxide (CO2) respiration flux estimation during calm summer nights, when a CO2 concentration gradient from soil/moss system to atmosphere builds up. Chambers greatly overestimated the night-time respiration. This was due to the disturbance caused by the chamber to the soil-moss CO2 gradient and consequent initial pulse of CO2 to the chamber headspace. We tested different flux calculation and measurement methods to solve this problem. The estimated flux was strongly dependent on (1) the starting point of the fit after closing the chamber, (2) the length of the fit, (3) the type of the fit (linear and polynomial), (4) the speed of the fan mixing the air inside the chamber, and (5) atmospheric turbulence (friction velocity, u*). The best fitting method (the most robust, least random variation) for respiration measurements on our sites was linear fitting with the period of 120–240 s after chamber closure. Furthermore, the fan should be adjusted to spin at minimum speed to avoid the pulse-effect, but it should be kept on to ensure mixing. If night-time problems cannot be solved, emissions can be estimated using daytime data from opaque chambers.},

abstract = {Factors controlling the seasonal and interannual variability of net ecosystem productivity (F NEP ), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (P g ), ecosystem respiration (R e ) and evapotranspiration (E) of a mature boreal black spruce forest in central Saskatchewan, Canada were investigated using eight years (1999–2006) of continuous eddy covariance measurements. During 2000–2006, which included a three-year drought, the forest was a weak sink for CO2 with annual F NEP ranging from 27 to 80 g C m-2 (56 ± 21 g C m−2 a−1). The beginning of the growing season occurred when daily mean air temperature exceeded 4°C and the near surface soil temperature equaled or exceeded 0°C. The length of the growing season varied from 186 to 232 days. During the extreme drought year (2003), the smaller reduction in annual P g than in R e resulted in highest F NEP of the record. Annual F NEP decreased slightly with increasing soil water content; however, there was evidence of increased F NEP due to high water table conditions in 2004 because of the slightly higher decrease in R e than P g . Although bulk surface conductance (g s ) decreased significantly during the dry conditions in 2003, the associated increase in D prevented a significant drop in E, which resulted in only a slight decline in evaporative fraction and almost no change in water use efficiency. Interannual variation inP g , R e and F NEP in the early growing season (April–June) and late growing season (July–September) was controlled by air temperature and soil water content, respectively. However, spring (April–May) mean air temperature was the main factor determining the interannual variation in annual F NEP . The effect of late growing season soil water content on annual P g and R e was greater than its effect on annual F NEP . The results emphasize the need to consider soil moisture conditions as well as temperature when simulating the response of the carbon balance components of this ecosystems to climate change.},

The two spruce forests shared similar vege-tation composition but differed in soil conditions.

The dry spruce forest (DSF) had a relatively thin organic layer (5 cm) with a deep water table ({\textgreater}60 cm). The measured multi-year average NEE fluxes (2000 and – 1440 kg C ha −1 yr −1 for WSF and DSF, respectively) indi-cated that WSF was a source while DSF a sink of atmo-spheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) during the experimental years. A process-based model, Forest-DNDC, was employed in the study to interpret the observations. The modeled multi-year average NEE fluxes were 1800 and –2200 kg C ha −1 yr −1 for WSF and DSF, respectively, which were comparable with observations. The modeled data also showed high soil het-erotrophic respiration rates at WSF that suggested that the water table fluctuation at WSF could have played a key role in determining the negative carbon balance in the wetland ecosystem. A sensitivity test was conducted by running Forest-DNDC with varied water table scenarios for WSF. The results indicated that the NEE fluxes from WSF were highly sensitive to the water table depth. When the water table was high, the WSF ecosystem maintained as a sink of atmospheric CO 2 ; while along with the drop of the water table the length of the flooded period reduced and more or-ganic matter in the soil profile suffered from rapid decompo-sition that gradually converted the ecosystem into a source of atmospheric CO 2 .

abstract = {We compared carbon storage and fluxes in young and old ponderosa pine stands in Oregon, including plant and soil storage, net primary productivity, respiration fluxes, eddy flux estimates of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and Biome-BGC simulations of fluxes. The young forest (Y site) was previously an old-growth ponderosa pine forest that had been clearcut in 1978, and the old forest (O site), which has never been logged, consists of two primary age classes (50 and 250 years old). Total ecosystem carbon content (vegetation, detritus and soil) of the O forest was about twice that of the Y site (21 vs. 10 kg C m(-2) ground), and significantly more of the total is stored in living vegetation at the O site (61{\%} vs. 15{\%}). Ecosystem respiration (R-e) was higher at the O site (1014 vs. 835 g C m(-2) year(-1)), and it was largely from soils at both sites (77{\%} of R-e). The biological data show that above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP), NPP and net ecosystem production (NEP) were greater at the O site than the Y site. Monte Carlo estimates of NEP show that the young site is a source of CO2 to the atmosphere, and is significantly lower than NEP(O) by c. 100 g C m(-2) year(-1). Eddy covariance measurements also show that the O site was a stronger sink for CO2 than the Y site. Across a 15-km swath in the region, ANPP ranged from 76 g C m(-2) year(-1) at the Y site to 236 g C m(-2) year(-1) (overall mean 158 +/- 14 g C m(-2) year(-1)). The lowest ANPP values were for the youngest and oldest stands, but there was a large range of ANPP for mature stands. Carbon, water and nitrogen cycle simulations with the Biome-BGC model suggest that disturbance type and frequency, time since disturbance, age-dependent changes in below-ground allocation, and increasing atmospheric concentration of CO2 all exert significant control on the net ecosystem exchange of carbon at the two sites. Model estimates of major carbon flux components agree with budget-based observations to within +/-20{\%}, with larger differences for NEP and for several storage terms. Simulations showed the period of regrowth required to replace carbon lost during and after a stand-replacing fire (O) or a clearcut (Y) to be between 50 and 100 years. In both cases, simulations showed a shift from net carbon source to net sink (on an annual basis) 10-20 years after disturbance. These results suggest that the net ecosystem production of young stands may be low because heterotrophic respiration, particularly from soils, is higher than the NPP of the regrowth. The amount of carbon stored in long-term pools (biomass and soils) in addition to short-term fluxes has important implications for management of forests in the Pacific North-west for carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Measurements over a period of 33 months are presented for the fluxes of carbon, sensible heat and water vapour over a tropical wet/dry savanna in northern Queensland (Virginia Park), and for 38 months over a cool temperate Eucalyptus forest in southeast Australia (Tumbarumba), as part of the OzFlux network. Fluxes were measured using micrometeorological methods and neural network analysis was used to fill gaps in the hourly flux time series. Productivity at Virginia Park is controlled by rainfall amount and timing during the wet season since this determines the leaf area index (Lai) of the C4grass understorey which varies greatly compared to Laiof the trees. The savanna lost 99 g C m-2over the period July 2001-March 2004 due to the failure of the 2002-2003 wet season when rainfall was in the lowest 20th percentile. Net uptake of carbon at Tumbarumba was 2510 g C m-2from February 2001 to March 2004, with annual productivity ranging from 1060 g C m-2year-1in a normal year to 360 g C m-2year-1during the 2002-2003 drought which affected all of eastern Australia. Annual rainfall at the savanna was matched by annual evapotranspiration, indicating there was no surface runoff or deep drainage during our study. Trees at both sites were able to extract water deep within the soil profile to maintain annual transpiration above rainfall during the drought of 2002-2003. Measurements of Laiand gross primary production (PG) at the two sites were compared to estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data products. The MOD15 algorithm overestimated Laiby a factor of two at Tumbarumba but gave reasonable magnitudes and seasonal variation for the savanna. At Tumbarumba, MOD17 gave excellent estimates of the annual amplitude in PGbut was less satisfactory in predicting the phase of the variations. MOD17 overestimated PGat Virginia Park during the dry season and the low-rainfall summer of 2002-2003 but gave satisfactory results during the other two wet seasons. Most of the variance in PGat both sites was explained by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. Significantly improved predictions were obtained for the savanna by modifying the MOD17 algorithm to account for rainfall and potential evaporation in the antecedent 3 months, a surrogate for soil water availability. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured in a wind-throw-disturbed upland spruce forest in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany) continuously over four years from 2009 to 2013 by the eddy-covariance method. Estimated annual NEE (positive values stand for a net carbon source) of the non-cleared wind-throw resulted in 347±104, 255±77, 221±66, 240±52, and 167±50gCm-2. However, two to six years after the storm event (windstorm Kyrill, January 2007) GEP was already strong, increasing from 393 (2009) to 649gCm-2yr-1(2013). Ecosystem respiration showed a high inter-annual variability during the measurement period, ranging from 656 to 816gCm-2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes during snow-covered periods averaged about 0.8$\mu$molm-2s-1with only little variation. The contributions of spruces and grasses to the overall carbon exchange, and the differentiation into autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration were estimated by the biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC (formerly MoBiLE). Comparisons with observations indicate that the model represents gross primary productivity very well, but underestimates ecosystem respiration during early spring and late autumn, and thus tends to diverge from measurements over multi-year simulation periods. These results show that (1) low productivity mountain forest sites may switch from a carbon source to a carbon sink within relatively few years after disturbance, and (2) model uncertainties are most prominently related to soil respiration, decomposition of coarse woody debris, and succession of ground cover species.},

abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) fluxes were measured fortnightly to monthly with manual chambers in 2004–2008 and hourly with automatic chambers during the snow-free seasons of 2007 and 2008 in a sedge fen in northern Finland. The fluxes were generally low, varying from −45 to 37 $\mu$g N 2 O–N m −2 hour −1 (negative fluxes indicating uptake of N 2 O from the atmosphere into the soil) and showing large spatial and temporal variation. Slightly higher emissions were observed in winter than in summer. On an annual scale, the fen acted as a N 2 O source. The annual balances showed a clear decreasing trend from 1.1 kg N ha −1 year −1 (= 12.2 $\mu$g N m −2 hour −1) in 2004 to zero balances in 2007 and 2008. Two potential reasons for the decreasing mean flux were (i) a decreasing atmospheric N deposition during the snow-free season, and (ii) a rising water-table level (WTL), which restricts the availability of oxygen in the peat and therefore favours the formation of molecular nitrogen (N 2) instead of N 2 O by the denitrifying microbes. The measurements conducted with the automatic chambers during the snow-free season showed a positive exponential relationship between the N 2 O flux and the temperature in 2008, but not in 2007. Similarly, a unimodal relationship with the WTL was found in 2008, with maximum fluxes observed when the WTL was about 4 cm above the fen surface. No diurnal variation in N 2 O fluxes measured by automatic chambers was found. The fluxes measured by the manual or automatic chambers were similar in magnitude, but different in their temporal pattern. The daily N 2 O concentration at a depth of 0.15 m in the peat was always lower than the ambient atmospheric concentration, indicating that at this depth the atmospheric N 2 O was consumed. Together with the observed negative flux rates this suggests that microbial N 2 production is a significant part of the N cycle in this fen.},

abstract = {We report on net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) measurements conducted with the eddy covariance method over agricultural peat soil in the 2-year period between October 2000 and October 2002. In 2001, spring barley and undersown grass were sown on the site. After the barley harvest, the perennial forage grass was left to grow, so that in 2002 the field was growing grass. A higher maximum net CO2 uptake was observed for barley than for grass during the height of the summer, peaking at about ?1.0 and ?0.75 mg CO2 m?2 s?1, respectively. The maximum nighttime total ecosystem respiration was measured in July and was similar for both crops, about 0.35 mg CO2 m?2s?1. During the growing season the field acted as a daily CO2 sink for only 40 days in barley versus 84 days in grass. In the winter the average carbon dioxide efflux varied from 15.6 to 16.5 mgCO2 m?2 s?1. The annual NEE of the agricultural peat soil growing barley and grass was 771 ± 104 and 290 ± 91 g CO2 m?2, respectively. The longer net CO2 uptake period was the main reason for the lower annual NEE for grass; however, owing to the higher amount of grass biomass produced the net ecosystem production (NEP), calculated as the sum of NEE and removed biomass, was slightly larger for grass (452 g C m?2) than for barley (336 g C m?2). These results show that the organic peat is still undergoing rapid decomposition after more than 100 years of cultivation activity. In addition, switching from an annual to a perennial crop did not turn the field into a CO2 sink, at least during a 1-year period.},

abstract = {Recent research highlights the important role of (semi-)arid ecosystems in the global carbon (C) cycle. However, detailed process based investigations are still necessary in order to fully understand how drylands behave and to determine the main factors currently affecting their C balance with the aim of predicting how climate change will affect their structure and functions. Here, we explore the potential biological and non-biological processes that may compose net CO2exchange in a semiarid grassland in southeast Spain by means of eddy covariance measurements registered over six hydrological years (2009–2015). Results point out the great importance of subterranean ventilation, an advective transport process causing net CO2release, especially during drought periods and under high-turbulence conditions. Accordingly, extreme CO2release, far exceeding that found in the literature, was measured over the whole study period (2009–2015) averaging 230 g C m−2 year−1; this occurred mostly during the dry season and was very unlikely to correspond to concurrent biological activity and variations of in situ organic C pools. Underground CO2concentrations corroborate this finding. In this regard, the potential origins of the released CO2could be geological degassing and/or subterranean translocation of CO2in both gaseous and aqueous phases. However, future research is needed in order to understand how CO2transport and production processes interact and modulate drylands' terrestrial C balance. Overall, the present study exposes how subterranean ventilation and hydrogeochemistry can complicate the interpretation of the terrestrial C cycle.},

abstract = {Croplands mainly act as net sources of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as nitrogen oxide (NO), a precursor of troposheric ozone. We determined the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) balance of a four-year crop rotation, including maize, wheat, barley and mustard, to provide a base for exploring mitigation options of net emissions. The crop rotation had a positive net ecosystem production (NEP) of 4.4 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) but represented a net source of carbon with a net biome production (NBP) of -1.3 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). The nitrogen balance of the rotation was correlated with the carbon balance and resulted in net loss (-24 +/- 28 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). The main nitrogen losses were nitrate leaching (-11.7 +/- 1.0 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and ammonia volatilization (-9 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Dry and wet depositions were 6.7 +/- 3.0 and 5.9 +/- 0.1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Fluxes of nitrous (N2O) and nitric (NO) oxides did not contribute significantly to the N budget (N2O: -1.8 +/- 0.04; NO: -0.7 +/- 0.04 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) but N2O fluxes equaled 16{\%} of the total greenhouse gas balance. The link between the carbon and nitrogen balances are discussed. Longer term experiments would be necessary to capture the trends in the carbon and nitrogen budgets within the variability of agricultural ecosystems.},

abstract = {The annual variability of CO2 exchange in most ecosystems is primarily driven by the activities of plants and soil microorganisms. However, little is known about the carbon balance and its controlling factors outside the growing season in Arctic regions dominated by soil freeze/thaw processes, long-lasting snow cover, and several months of darkness. This study presents a complete annual cycle of the CO2 net ecosystem exchange (NEE) dynamics for a high Arctic tundra area at the west coast of Svalbard based on eddy covariance flux measurements. The annual cumulative CO2 budget is close to 0 g C m-2 yr-1, but displays a strong seasonal variability. Four major CO2 exchange seasons have been identified. (1) During summer (snow-free ground), the CO2 exchange occurs mainly as a result of biological activity, with a dominance of strong CO2 assimilation by the ecosystem. (2) The autumn (snow-free ground or partly snow-covered) is dominated by CO2 respiration as a result of biological activity. (3) In winter and spring (snow-covered ground), low but persistent CO2 release occurs, overlayed by considerable CO2 exchange events in both directions associated with high wind speed and changes of air masses and atmospheric air pressure. (4) The snow melt season (pattern of snow-free and snow-covered areas) is associated with both meteorological and biological forcing, resulting in a carbon uptake by the high Arctic ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

abstract = {To understand the dynamics of ecosystem carbon cycling, CO2fluxes were measured over and under an oak-grass savanna and over a proximate grassland in California. The measurements were made from 2000 to 2006 using the eddy covariance technique. Annual net carbon exchange (NEE) ranged from -155 to -56 gC m-2year-1and from -88 to 141 gC m-2year-1at the savanna and nearby grassland, respectively. Inter-annual variability in NEE was significantly related to length of growing season for the savanna, grassland, and tree canopy. We partitioned the NEE into two separate terms-primary productivity (GPP) and respiration (ecosystem respiration, Reco)-and found that the GPP and Recoof the savanna and grassland depended primarily on the amount of seasonal precipitation that occurred while grass and tree canopies were simultaneously active rather than depending on annual precipitation. We also found that NEE was greatly constrained by both Recoand GPP and Recowas significantly constrained by GPP. Recoincreased by 79 gC m-2year-1with each 100 gC m-2year-1increase in GPP. In addition, measuring CO2exchange separately in the overstory and understory of the savanna over multiple years enabled us to partition Recointo heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration terms in a new and direct way. The sensitivity of Recoto GPP (dReco/dGPP) and the baseline of respiration terms both provide useful tools for understanding the dynamics of ecosystem CO2uptake under current conditions of climate and ecosystem succession stage. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Synchronous sonic anemometric measurements at five heights within a mixed coniferous forest were used to test two different parameterisations of canopy architecture in the application of a second-order turbulence closure model. In the computation of the leaf drag area, the aerodynamic sheltering was replaced with an architectural sheltering, assumed to be analogous to the clumping index defined in radiative transfer theory. Consequently, the ratio of leaf area density and sheltering factor was approximated by the effective leaf area or the mean contact number, both obtained from the inversion of non-destructive optical measurements. The first parameter represents the equivalent randomly dispersed leaf area in terms of shading, the second is the average number of leaves that a straight line intercepts penetrating the canopy with a certain zenith angle. The selection of this direction was determined by the analysis of the mean angle of the wind vector during sweep events. The drag coefficient values obtained from the inversion of the momentum flux equation, using the two proposed parameterisations, are in good agreement with values found in the literature. The predicted profiles of turbulence statistics reasonably match actual measurements, especially in the case of the mean contact number parameterisation. The vertical profile of leaf drag area, obtained by forcing the turbulence model to match the observed standard deviation of vertical velocity (sigma(w)), is intermediate between the two empirical ones. Finally, the proposed canopy parameterisations were applied to a Lagrangian transport model to predict vertical profiles of air temperature, {\{}H2O{\}} and {\{}CO2{\}} concentration.},

abstract = {Seven years of continuous eddy covariance measurements at an alpine meadow were used to investigate the impacts of climate drivers and ecosystem responses on the inter-annual variability (IAV) of the net ecosystem exchange (NEE). The annual cumulative value of NEE was positive (source) in 2003, 2005 and 2009 (50, 15 and 112gm-2respectively) and negative (sink) in 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 (29, 75, 110 and 28gm-2respectively). The IAV of carbon dioxide fluxes builds up in two phenological phases: the onset of the growing season (triggered by snow melting) and the canopy re-growth after mowing. Respiratory fluxes during the non-growing season were observed to increase IAV, while growing season uptake dampened it. A novel approach was applied to factor out the two main sources of IAV: climate drivers' variability and changes in the ecosystem responses to climate. Annual values of carbon dioxide fluxes were calculated assuming (a) variable climate and variable ecosystem response among years, (b) variable climate and constant ecosystem response and (c) constant climate and variable ecosystem response. The analysis of flux variances calculated under these three assumptions indicates the occurrence of an important negative feedback between climate and ecosystem responses. Due to this feedback, the observed IAV of NEE is lower than one would expect for a given climate variability, because of the counteracting changes in ecosystem responses. This alpine meadow therefore demonstrates the ability to acclimatise and to limit the IAV of carbon fluxes induced by climate variability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The recovery of ecosystem C and N dynamics after disturbance can be a slow process. Chronosequence approaches offer unique opportunities to use space-for-time substitution to quantify the recovery of ecosystem C and N stocks and estimate the potential of restoration practices for C sequestration. We studied the distribution of C and N stocks in two chronosequences that included long-term cultivated lands, 3-to 26-year-old prairie restorations, and remnant prairie on two related soil series. Results from the two chronosequences did not vary significantly and were combined. Based on modeling predictions, the recovery rates of different ecosystem components varied greatly. Overall, C stocks recovered faster than N stocks, but both C and N stocks recovered more rapidly for aboveground vegetation than for any other ecosystem component. Aboveground C and N reached 95{\%} of remnant levels in only 13 years and 21 years, respectively, after planting to native vegetation. Belowground plant C and N recovered several decades later, while microbial biomass C, soil organic C (SOC), and total soil N recovered on a century timescale. In the cultivated fields, SOC concentrations were depleted within the surface 25 cm, coinciding with the depth of plowing, but cultivation apparently led to redistribution of soil C, increasing SOC stocks deeper in the soil profile. The restoration of prairie vegetation was effective at rebuilding soil organic matter (SOM) in the surface soil. Accrual rates were maintained at 43 g C{\'{A}}m {\`{A}}2 {\'{A}}yr {\`{A}}1 and 3 g N{\'{A}}m {\`{A}}2 {\'{A}}yr {\`{A}}1 in the surface 0.16 Mg/m 2 soil mass during the first 26 years of restoration and were predicted to reach 50{\%} of their storage potential (3500 g C/m 2) in the first 100 years. We conclude that restoration of tallgrass prairie vegetation can restore SOM lost through cultivation and has the potential to sequester relatively large amounts of SOC over a sustained period of time. Whether restored prairies can retain the C apparently transferred to the subsoil by cultivation practices remains to be seen.},

abstract = {Eddy-covariance measurements are performed at several hundred sites all over the world on a long-term basis. The gathered data are used to characterise ecosystem exchanges of trace gases, water and energy and to validate or constrain process-based models. There is an increasing demand on standardised and comprehensive quality flagging and uncertainty quantification of these fluxes. In this paper, we review established quality assessment procedures and present a comprehensive newly composed strategy emphasising tests on high-frequency raw data, expanding existing tests on statistics, fluxes and corrections, plus quantification of errors. Moreover, representativity of fluxes is checked by footprint analysis. This strategy is applied within the recently launched TERENO network of ecosystem observatories, and its robustness is demonstrated for data acquired with different measurement set-ups. Four test data sets from TERENO and one data set from CarboEurope-IP were subjected to this quality assessment. The presented strategy is compared with established quality assessment schemes, and it is demonstrated that unrealistic fluxes are now efficiently excluded while retaining the largest possible amount of high quality data. Additionally, the algorithms applied provide comprehensive, reproducible, qualitative and quantitative uncertainty estimates for users of eddy-covariance flux data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A long-term flux measurement station has been established in a 74-year-old mixedwood forest ecosystem, located approximately 80 km west of Timmins in northern Ontario, as part of the Fluxnet-Canada Research Network (FCRN). Measurements of energy, water vapour, and carbon dioxide fluxes have been made continuously since August 2003 using the eddy covariance technique, along with ancillary meteorological variables. The spatial structure of the site was evaluated using a variety of sources and techniques, including remote sensing, showing that this forest is mixed but relatively homogeneous. The canopy top height is remarkably constant at between 30 and 32 m. The basal area varies from 18 to 27 m2ha-1, and the aboveground biomass ranges from 82 to 122 Mg ha-1. In this paper, we summarize the diurnal and seasonal patters of carbon dioxide exchange and water loss from September 1, 2003 to August 31, 2004. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is strongly related to temperature. Atmospheric vapour pressure deficit (VPD) in this ecosystem exerted strong biophysical control on the daily gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and evapotranspiration. Seasonal change in shortwave albedo, as a result of the presence of mixed deciduous and coniferous species, was clearly evident. Albedo changes were comparable to the seasonal pattern of NEP. The dormant season lasts more than 6 months of the year at this station. This forest was a moderate sink of carbon over the measurement period. Annual values of GEP, ecosystem respiration (R), and NEP were 1075, 919, and 156 ± 35 g C m-2, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {AIMS: Despite multiple studies investigating the environmental controls on CH4 fluxes from arctic tundra ecosystems, the high spatial variability of CH4 emissions is not fully understood. This makes the upscaling of CH4 fluxes from plot to regional scale, particularly challenging. The goal of this study is to refine our knowledge of the spatial variability and controls on CH4 emission from tundra ecosystems. METHODS: CH4 fluxes were measured in four sites across a variety of wet-sedge and tussock tundra ecosystems in Alaska using chambers and a Los Gatos CO2 and CH4 gas analyser. RESULTS: All sites were found to be sources of CH4, with northern sites (in Barrow) showing similar CH4 emission rates to the southernmost site (ca. 300 km south, Ivotuk). Gross primary productivity (GPP), water level and soil temperature were the most important environmental controls on CH4 emission. Greater vascular plant cover was linked with higher CH4 emission, but this increased emission with increased vascular plant cover was much higher (86 {\%}) in the drier sites, than the wettest sites (30 {\%}), suggesting that transport and/or substrate availability were crucial limiting factors for CH4 emission in these tundra ecosystems. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study provides an increased understanding of the fine scale spatial controls on CH4 flux, in particular the key role that plant cover and GPP play in enhancing CH4 emissions from tundra soils.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}While the eddy covariance technique has become an important technique for estimating long-term ecosystem carbon balance, under certain conditions the measured turbulent flux of carbon at a given height above an ecosystem does not represent the true surface flux. Profile systems have been deployed to measure periodic storage of carbon below the measurement height, but have not been widely adopted. This is most likely due to the additional expense and complexity, and possibly also the perception – given that net storage over intervals exceeding 24 hours is generally negligible – that these measurements are not particularly important. In this study, we used a three year record of net ecosystem exchange of carbon and simultaneous measurements of carbon storage to ascertain the relative contributions of turbulent carbon flux, storage and advection (calculated as a residual quantity) to the nocturnal carbon balance, and to quantify the effect of neglecting storage. The conditions at the site are in relative terms highly favourable for eddy covariance measurements, yet we found a substantial contribution ({\~{}}{\&}thinsp;40{\&}thinsp;{\%}) of advection to nocturnal turbulent flux underestimation. The most likely mechanism for advection is cooling-induced drainage flows, the effects of which were observed in the storage measurements. The remaining {\~{}}{\&}thinsp;60{\&}thinsp;{\%} of flux underestimation was due to storage of carbon. We also showed that substantial underestimation of carbon uptake (approximately 80{\&}thinsp;gC{\&}thinsp;m{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;a{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, or 25{\&}thinsp;{\%} of annual carbon uptake) arose when standard methods of nocturnal flux correction were implemented in the absence of storage estimates. These biases were much larger than quantifiable uncertainties in the data. Neglect of storage also distorted the relationships between the carbon exchange processes (respiration and photosynthesis) and their key controls (light and temperature, respectively). We conclude that addition of storage measurements to eddy covariance sites with all but the lowest measurement heights should be a high priority for the flux measurement community.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The ecosystems for which data were available ranged in mean annual rainfall from 320 mm (Sudan) to 1150 mm (Republic of Congo) and include a spectrum of vegetation types (or land cover) (open savannas, woodlands, croplands and grasslands). Given the shortness of the record, the EC data were analysed across the network rather than longitudinally at sites, in order to understand the driving factors for ecosystem respiration and carbon assimilation, and to reveal the different water use strategies in these highly seasonal environments. Values for maximum net carbon assimilation rates (photosynthesis) ranged from -12.5 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) in a dry, open Millet cropland (C(4)-plants) up to -48 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1) for a tropical moist grassland. Maximum carbon assimilation rates were highly correlated with mean annual rainfall (r(2)=0.74). Maximum photosynthetic uptake rates (Fp(max)) were positively related to satellite-derived f(APAR). Ecosystem respiration was dependent on temperature at all sites, and was additionally dependent on soil water content at sites receiving less than 1000 mm of rain per year. All included ecosystems dominated by C(3)-plants, showed a strong decrease in 30-min assimilation rates with increasing water vapour pressure deficit above 2.0 kPa.},

abstract = {Ecosystem flux measurements using the eddy covariance (EC) technique were undertaken in 4 subsequent years during summer for a total of 562 days in an arctic wet tundra ecosystem, located near Cherskii, Far-Eastern Federal District, Russia. Methane (CH4) emissions were measured using permanent chambers. The experimental field is characterized by late thawing of permafrost soils in June and periodic spring floods. A stagnant water table below the grass canopy is fed by melting of the active layer of permafrost and by flood water. Following 3 years of EC measurements, the site was drained by building a 3 m wide drainage channel surrounding the EC tower to examine possible future effects of global change on the tundra tussock ecosystem. Cumulative summertime net carbon fluxes before experimental alteration were estimated to be about + 15 g C m(-2) (i.e. an ecosystem C loss) and + 8 g C m(-2) after draining the study site. When taking CH4 as another important greenhouse gas into account and considering the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 vs. CO2, the ecosystem had a positive GWP during all summers. However CH4 emissions after drainage decreased significantly and therefore the carbon related greenhouse gas flux was much smaller than beforehand (475 253 g C-CO2-e m(-2) before drainage in 2003 vs. 23 26 g C-CO2-e m(-2) after drainage in 2005).

abstract = {The first full greenhouse gas (GHG) flux budget of an intensively managed grassland in Switzerland (Chamau) is presented. The three major trace gases, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured with the eddy covariance (EC) technique. For CO2 concentrations, an open-path infrared gas analyzer was used, while N2O and CH4 concentrations were measured with a recently developed continuous-wave quantum cascade laser absorption spectrometer (QCLAS). We investigated the magnitude of these trace gas emissions after grassland restoration, including ploughing, harrowing, sowing, and fertilization with inorganic and organic fertilizers in 2012. Large peaks of N2O fluxes (20-50 nmol m(-2) s(-1) compared with a {\textless}5 nmol m(-2) s(-1) background) were observed during thawing of the soil after the winter period and after mineral fertilizer application followed by re-sowing in the beginning of the summer season. Nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes were controlled by nitrogen input, plant productivity, soil water content and temperature. Management activities led to increased variations of N2O fluxes up to 14 days after the management event as compared with background fluxes measured during periods without management ({\textless}5 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). Fluxes of CO2 remained small until full plant development in early summer 2012. In contrast, methane emissions showed only minor variations over time. The annual GHG flux budget was dominated by N2O (48{\%} contribution) and CO2 emissions (44{\%}). CH4 flux contribution to the annual budget was only minor (8{\%}). We conclude that recently developed multi-species QCLAS in an EC system open new opportunities to determine the temporal variation of N2O and CH4 fluxes, which further allow to quantify annual emissions. With respect to grassland restoration, our study emphasizes the key role of N2O and CO2 losses after ploughing, changing a permanent grassland from a carbon sink to a significant carbon source.},

abstract = {Measurements of water vapour flux from semi-arid perennial woodland (mallee) were made for 3years using eddy covariance instrumentation. There have been no previous long-term, detailed measures of water use in this ecosystem. Latent energy flux (LE) on a half hourly basis was the measure of the combined soil and plant evaporation, 'evapotranspiration' (E{\textless}inf{\textgreater}LE{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) of the site. Aggregation over 3years of the site measured rain (1136mm) and the estimated evaporation (794mm) suggests that 342mm or 30{\%} of rain had moved into or past the root zone of the vegetation. Above average rainfall during 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 (633mm, 15months) would likely have been the period during which significant groundwater recharge occurred. At times immediately after rainfall, E{\textless}inf{\textgreater}LE{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} rates were the same or exceeded estimates of potential E calculated from a suitably parameterized Penman-Monteith (E{\textless}inf{\textgreater}PMo{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) equation. Apparent free water E from plant interception and soil evaporation was about 2.3mm and lasted for 1.3days following rainfall in summer, while in autumn, E was 5.1mm that lasted over 5.4days. The leaf area index (LAI) needed to adjust a wind function calibrated Penman equation (E{\textless}inf{\textgreater}PMe{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) to match the E{\textless}inf{\textgreater}LE{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values could be back calculated to generate seasonal change in LAI from 0.12 to 0.46 and compared well with normalized difference vegetation index; r=0.38 and p=0.0213* and LAI calculated from digital cover photography. The apparently conservative response of perennial vegetation evaporation to available water in these semi-arid environments reinforces the conclusion that these ecosystems use this mechanism to survive the reasonably common dry periods. Plant response to soil water availability is primarily through gradual changes in leaf area.},

We explored the ability of the process-based model BIOME-BGC to estimate the gross primary production (GPP) using an inverse modeling approach exploiting eddy covariance and satellite data. We firstly present a version of BIOME-BGC coupled with the radiative transfer models PROSPECT and SAILH (named PROSAILH-BGC) with the aims of i) improving the BIOME-BGC description of the radiative transfer regime within the canopy and ii) allowing the assimilation of remotely-sensed vegetation index time series, such as MODIS NDVI, into the model. Secondly, we present a two-step model inversion for optimization of model parameters. In the first step, some key ecophysiological parameters were optimized against data collected by an eddy covariance flux tower. In the second step, important information about phenological dates and about standing biomass were optimized against MODIS NDVI. Results obtained showed that the PROSAILH-BGC allowed simulation of MODIS NDVI with good accuracy and that we described better the canopy radiation regime. The inverse modeling approach was demonstrated to be useful for the optimization of ecophysiological model parameters, phenological dates and parameters related to the standing biomass, allowing good accuracy of daily and annual GPP predictions. In summary, this study showed that assimilation of eddy covariance and remote sensing data in a process model may provide important information for modeling gross primary production at regional scale.},

The eddy covariance method was used to compare ecosystem fluxes of carbon dioxide between harvested and burned boreal forest sites in Saskatchewan, Canada. The harvest chronosequence had sites harvested in 2002 (HJP02), 1994 (HJP94) and 1975 (HJP75), whereas the fire chronosequence sites were burned in 1998 (F98), 1989 (F89), 1977 (F77) and 1929 (OJP). All sites were dominated by jack pine prior to the disturbance. During 2004 and 2005, net ecosystem production showed an average carbon gain (g C m-2year-1) at F89 = 84, HJP75 = 80, HJP94 = 14 and OJP = 20. The other sites lost carbon (g C m-2year-1) at HJP02 = -139, F98 = -20, and F77 = -58. Gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (Re) and evapotranspiration tended to be greater at the burned sites than the harvested sites. The F89 and F77 sites had the strongest response of GEP to photosynthetically active radiation, and the strongest response of Reto soil temperature at the 2-cm depth. HJP02 had the weakest responses, followed by HJP94. This apparent greater ecosystem activity at the burned sites is likely caused by local differences in soil moisture and nutrients, differences in vegetation development, and differences in the decomposition of coarse woody debris. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We studied net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) dynamics in a high-elevation, subalpine forest in Colorado, USA, over a two-year period. Annual carbon sequestration for the forest was 6.71 mol C m(-2) (80.5 g C m(-2) for the year between November 1, 1998 and October 31, 1999, and 4.80 mol C m(-2) (57.6 g C m(-2) for the year between November 1, 1999 and October 31, 2000. Despite its evergreen nature, the forest did not exhibit net CO2 uptake during the winter, even during periods of favourable weather. The largest fraction of annual carbon sequestration occurred in the early growing-season; during the first 30 days of both years. Reductions in the rate of carbon sequestration after the first 30 days were due to higher ecosystem respiration rates when mid-summer moisture was adequate (as in the first year of the study) or lower mid-day photosynthesis rates when mid-summer moisture was not adequate (as in the second year of the study). The lower annual rate of carbon sequestration during the second year of the study was due to lower rates of CO2 uptake during both the first 30 days of the growing season and the mid-summer months. The reduction in CO2 uptake during the first 30 days of the second year was due to an earlier-than-normal spring warm-up, which caused snow melt during a period when air temperatures were lower and atmospheric vapour pressure deficits were higher, compared to the first 30 days of the first year. The reduction in CO2 uptake during the mid-summer of the second year was due to an extended drought, which was accompanied by reduced latent heat exchange and increased sensible heat exchange. Day-to-day variation in the daily integrated NEE during the summers of both years was high, and was correlated with frequent convective storm clouds and concomitant variation in the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD). Carbon sequestration rates were highest when some cloud cover was present, which tended to diffuse the photosynthetic photon flux, compared to periods with completely clear weather. The results of this study are in contrast to those of other studies that have reported increased annual NEE during years with earlier-than-normal spring warming. In the current study, the lower annual NEE during 2000, the year with the earlier spring warm-up, was due to (1) coupling of the highest seasonal rates of carbon sequestration to the spring climate, rather than the summer climate as in other forest ecosystems that have been studied, and (2) delivery of snow melt water to the soil when the spring climate was cooler and the atmosphere drier than in years with a later spring warm-up. Furthermore, the strong influence of mid-summer precipitation on CO2 uptake rates make it clear that water supplied by the spring snow melt is a seasonally limited resource, and summer rains are critical for sustaining high rates of annual carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {A new method is proposed for the computation of CO2 Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) and its components in a forest ecosystem. Advective flux is estimated by taking into account the air mass conservation principle. For this purpose, wind and dry air density values on the surface of the control volume are first corrected and then the advective flux is estimated on the surface of the control volume. Turbulent flux is also computed along the surface of the control volume while storage flux is computed inside the volume. Additional characteristics of this method are that incompressibility of the mean flow is not assumed a priori, and that vertical and horizontal advective fluxes are not treated separately, but their sum is estimated directly. The methodology is applied to experimental data collected with a three-dimensional scheme at the alpine site of Renon during the Advex project (July 2005). The advection flux was found to be prevailing positive at night and negative during the day, as was found in previous studies on advection for the same site, but showed a lower scatter in half-hour calculated values. We tested the effect of its summation on turbulent and storage fluxes to produce half-hourly values of NEE. Nighttime NEE values were used in functional relations with soil temperature, daytime values with PPFD. The effect of addition of the advection component was an increase in the values of parameters indicating ecosystem respiration, quantum yield, and photosynthetic capacity. The coefficient of correlation between NEE and environmental drivers increased.},

abstract = {Methane (CH4) emissions were measured at the Wilma H. Schiermeier Olentangy River Wetland Research Park (ORWRP) over three summers and two winters using an eddy covariance system. We used an empirical model to determine the main environmental drivers of methane emissions. Methane emissions covary strongly with water vapor fluxes, CO2 fluxes, and soil temperature. We adjust our models to account for the heterogeneous environment of the wetland by including the flux footprint distribution among different microsites as a predictive variable in the methane model. We used a forward linear stepwise model in combination with an Akaike information criteria-based model selection process and neural network modeling to determine which environmental variables are most effective in modeling methane emissions in our site. Different models and environmental variables best represented methane fluxes in the winter and summer and also during the day or night within each season. We parameterized an optimal empirical model for methane emissions from the ORWRP that is used for gap filling of site-level methane fluxes over 2 years. Some of the most effective variables for modeling methane were carbon, water vapor, and heat fluxes, all of which typically have the same data gaps as the time series of methane flux. In order to determine if these variables were useful for modeling methane despite the additional gap-filling error, we determined through an error propagation experiment that eddy covariance gap-filling models for methane may be best developed by including other gap-filled fluxes as predictors, despite the high level of shared gaps and subsequent gap-fill error propagation},

abstract = {Eddy covariance measurements of CO2fluxes were conducted in 2004 at the agricultural site of Lonz{\'{e}}e, Belgium, over a sugar beet crop. Additional measurements of biomass net primary production and leaf area index (LAI) were carried out. The response of the fluxes to climatic and non-climatic variables was analysed. Nighttime fluxes were dependent on turbulence, temperature and high soil water content. The u*correction was determined using a statistically based algorithm. The lower u*threshold was 0.1 m s-1. Daytime fluxes during maximum canopy development depended mainly on incident radiation and its repartition between direct and diffuse components. A limited response to saturation deficit and soil water content was also observed. The evolution of assimilation and respiration throughout the growing season was studied. Maximum assimilation fluxes were observed in July when canopy had not fully developed and these then decreased from the end of July to the harvest, due not only to a reduction in radiation but also to a reduction in canopy assimilation capacity. Normalised respiration evolution presented two peaks during the year: the first in July, when the assimilation was at its greatest, and the second after the harvest, during the crop residues decomposition. The annual sequestration, estimated by half-hourly flux summing and measurement gap filling, was -0.61 ± 0.11 kg C m-2and the impact of the u*correction and of the residues decomposition was estimated to be 5.3 and 3.5{\%}, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Here, the year 2011 characteristics of evapotranspiration and the energy budget of a black spruce forest underlain by permafrost in interior Alaska were explored. Energy balance was nearly closed during summer, and the mean value of the daily energy balance ratio (the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy) from June to August was 1.00, though a large energy balance deficit was observed in the spring. Such a deficit was explained partly by the energy consumed by snowmelt. Ground heat flux played an important role in the energy balance, explaining 26.5{\%} of net radiation during summer. The mean daily evapotranspiration of this forest during summer was 1.37mmday-1 - considered typical for boreal forests. The annual evapotranspiration and sublimation yielded 207.3mmyear-1, a value much smaller than the annual precipitation. Sublimation accounted for 8.8{\%} (18.2mmyear-1) of the annual evapotranspiration and sublimation; thus, the sublimation is not negligible in the annual water balance in boreal forests. The daytime average decoupling coefficient was very small, and the mean value was 0.05 during summer. Thus, evapotranspiration from this forest was mostly explained by the component from the dryness of the air, resulting from the aerodynamically rough surface of this forest. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.},

abstract = {The age-dependent variability of ecosystem carbon (C) fluxes was assessed by measuring the net ecosystem exchange of C (NEE) in five managed forest stands in northern Wisconsin, USA. The study sites ranged in age from 3-year-old clearcut to mature stands (65 years). All stands, except the clearcut, accumulated C over the study period from May to October 2002. Seasonal NEE estimates were -655 +/- 17.5 g C m(-2) in the mature hardwood (MHW), -648 +/- 16.8 in the mature red pine (MRP), -195 +/- 15.6 in the pine barrens (PB), +128 +/- 17.1 in the young hardwood clearcut (YHW), and -313 +/- 14.6 in the young red pine (YRP). The age-dependent differences were similar in the hardwood and conifer forests. Even though PB was not part of either the hardwood or conifer chronosequence, and had a different disturbance agent, it still fits the same general age relationship. Higher ecosystem respiration (ER) in the young than in the mature stands was the combined result of earlier soil warming in spring, and higher temperature and greater biological activity in summer, as indicated by temperature-normalized respiration rates. The fire-generated PB had lower ER than the harvest-generated YHW and YRP, where high ER was sustained partly on account of logging residue. During the main growing season, the equivalent of 31 (MHW), 48 (MRP), 68 (PB), 114 (YHW) and 71{\%} (YRP) of daily gross ecosystem production (GEP) was released in ER during the same day. The lower ER:GEP ratio in the mature stands was driven by greater age-dependent changes in ER than GEP. The magnitude of the increase in ER:GEP ratio in spring and fall was interpreted as the extent of the decoupling of ER and GEP. Decoupling (sustained high ER despite decreasing GEP) was observed in YHW, PB and MHW, whereas in coniferous stands (MRP and YRP) the stable ER:GEP ratio suggested preferential use of new photosynthates in ER. The results indicate that a great part of the variation in landscape-level C fluxes can be accounted for by mean stand age and associated parameters, which highlights the need to consider this source of heterogeneity in regional C balance estimates.},

abstract = {* Climate change projections predict an intensifying hydrologic cycle and an increasing frequency of droughts, yet quantitative understanding of the effects on ecosystem carbon exchange remains limited. * Here, the effect of contrasting precipitation and soil moisture dynamics were evaluated on forest carbon exchange using 2 yr of eddy covariance and microclimate data from a 50-yr-old mixed oak woodland in northern Ohio, USA. * The stand accumulated 40{\%} less carbon in a year with drought between bud-break and full leaf expansion (354 +/- 81 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2004 and 252 +/- 45 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2005). This was caused by greater suppression of gross ecosystem productivity (GEP; 16{\%} = 200 g) than of ecosystem respiration (ER; 11{\%} = 100 g) by drought. Suppressed GEP was traced to lower leaf area, lower apparent quantum yield and lower canopy conductance. The moisture sensitivity of ER may have been mediated by GEP. * The results highlight the vulnerability of the ecosystem to even a moderate drought, when it affects a critical aspect of development. Although the drought was preceded by rain, the storage capacity of the soil seemed limited to 1-2 wk, and therefore droughts longer than this are likely to impair productivity in the region.},

abstract = {The functioning of Arctic ecosystems is not only critically affected by climate change, but it also has the potential for major positive feedback on climate. There is, however, relatively little information on the role, patterns, and vulnerabilities of CO2 fluxes during the nonsummer seasons in Arctic ecosystems. Presented here is a year-round study of CO2 fluxes in an Alaskan Arctic tussock tundra ecosystem, and key environmental controls on these fluxes. Important controls on fluxes vary by season. This paper also presents a new empirical quantification of seasons in the Arctic based on net radiation. The fluxes were computed using standard FluxNet methodology and corrected using standard Webb-Pearman-Leuning density terms adjusted for influences of open-path instrument surface heating. The results showed that the nonsummer season comprises a significant source of carbon to the atmosphere. The summer period was a net sink of 24.3g Cm?2, while the nonsummer seasons released 37.9 g Cm?2. This release is 1.6 times the summer uptake, resulting in a net annual source of +13.6 g Cm?2 to the atmosphere. These findings support early observations of a change in this particular region of the Arctic from a long-term annual sink of CO2 to an annual source from the terrestrial ecosystem and soils to the atmosphere. The results presented here demonstrate that nearly continuous observations may be required in order to accurately calculate the annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange of Arctic ecosystems and to build predictive understanding that can be used to estimate, with confidence, Arctic fluxes under future conditions.},

abstract = {Wetlands and flooded peatlands can sequester large amounts of carbon (C) and have high greenhouse gas mitigation potential. There is growing interest in financing wetland restoration using C markets; however, this requires careful accounting of both CO2 and CH4 exchange at the ecosystem scale. Here we present a new model, the PEPRMT model (Peatland Ecosystem Photosynthesis Respiration and Methane Transport), which consists of a hierarchy of biogeochemical models designed to estimate CO2 and CH4 exchange in restored managed wetlands. Empirical models using temperature and/or photosynthesis to predict respiration and CH4 production were contrasted with a more process-based model that simulated substrate-limited respiration and CH4 production using multiple carbon pools. Models were parameterized by using a model-data fusion approach with multiple years of eddy covariance data collected in a recently restored wetland and a mature restored wetland. A third recently restored wetland site was used for model validation. During model validation, the process-based model explained 70{\%} of the variance in net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) and 50{\%} of the variance in CH4 exchange. Not accounting for high respiration following restoration led to empirical models overestimating annual NEE by 33–51{\%}. By employing a model-data fusion approach we provide rigorous estimates of uncertainty in model predictions, accounting for uncertainty in data, model parameters, and model structure. The PEPRMT model is a valuable tool for understanding carbon cycling in restored wetlands and for application in carbon market-funded wetland restoration, thereby advancing opportunity to counteract the vast degradation of wetlands and flooded peatlands.},

The contribution of individual NPP and respiration component fluxes varied considerably across the age-sequence, introducing different levels of uncertainty. Biometric and EC-based estimates both suggested that annual NPP, GPP, RE, and NEP were greatest at the 19-year-old site. Four-year mean values of NEP(B) and NEP(EC) were similar at the 6-year-old seedling (77 and 66gCm-2y-1) and the 69-year-old mature site (135 and 124gCm-2y-1), but differed considerably at the 19-year-old (439 and 736gCm-2y-1) and the 34-year-old sites (170 and 392gCm-2y-1). Both methods suggested similar patterns for inter-annual variability in GPP and NEP. Multi-year convergence of NEP(B) and NEP(EC) was not observed over the study period. Ecosystem C use efficiency was correlated to both forest NEP(EC) and NPP(B) suggesting that high productive forests (e.g. middle-age stands) were more efficient in sequestering C compared to low productive forests (e.g. seedling and mature stands). Similarly, negative and positive relationships of forest productivity with the total belowground C flux (TBCF) to GPP ratio and with the ratio of autotrophic to heterotrophic respiration (RA:RH), respectively, determined inter-annual and inter-site differences in C allocation. Integrating NEP across the age-sequence resulted in a total net C sequestration of 137 and 229tCha-1 over the initial 70 years as estimated by the biometric and EC method, respectively. Total ecosystem C sequestered in biomass at the 69-year-old site suggested an accumulation of 160tCha-1. These three estimates resulted in a mean C sequestration of 175±48tCha-1. This study demonstrates that comparing estimates from independent methods is imperative to constrain C budgets and C dynamics in forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The exchange of CO2between the atmosphere and a beech forest near Sor{\o}, Denmark, was measured continuously over 14years (1996-2009). The simultaneous measurement of many parameters that influence CO2uptake makes it possible to relate the CO2exchange to recent changes in e.g. temperature and atmospheric CO2concentration. The net CO2exchange (NEE) was measured by the eddy covariance method. Ecosystem respiration (RE) was estimated from nighttime values and gross ecosystem exchange (GEE) was calculated as the sum of RE and NEE. Over the years the beech forest acted as a sink of on average of 157gCm-2yr-1. In one of the years only, the forest acted as a small source. During 1996-2009 a significant increase in annual NEE was observed. A significant increase in GEE and a smaller and not significant increase in RE was also found. Thus the increased NEE was mainly attributed to an increase in GEE. The overall trend in NEE was significant with an average increase in uptake of 23gCm-2yr-2. The carbon uptake period (i.e. the period with daily net CO2gain) increased by 1.9days per year, whereas there was a non significant tendency of increase of the leafed period. This means that the leaves stayed active longer. The analysis of CO2uptake by the forest by use of light response curves, revealed that the maximum rate of photosynthetic assimilation increased by 15{\%} during the 14-year period. We conclude that the increase in the overall CO2uptake of the forest is due to a combination of increased growing season length and increased uptake capacity. We also conclude that long time series of flux measurements are necessary to reveal trends in the data because of the substantial inter-annual variation in the flux. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract: Afforestation has been proposed as an effective tool for protecting primary and/or secondary forests and for mitigating atmospheric CO2. However, the dynamics of primary productivity differs between plantations and natural forests. The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential for carbon storage of a commercial pine plantation by determining its carbon balance. Measurements started when trees were aged 6 and ended when they were older than 8 years. We measured CO2 and water vapor concentrations using the Eddy covariance method. Gross primary productivity in 2010 and 2011 was 4290 ± 473 g C m-2 and 4015 ± 485 g C m-2, respectively. Ecosystem respiration ranged between 7 and 20 g C m-2 d-1, reaching peaks in all Februaries. Of the 30 months monitored, the plantation acted as carbon source for 21 months and as carbon sink for 6 months, while values close to neutrality were obtained during 3 months. The positive balance representing CO2 loss by the system was most likely due to the cut branches left on the ground following pruning activities.

abstract = {The use of eddy covariance (EC) CO2 flux measurements in data assimilation and other applications requires an estimate of the random uncertainty. In previous studies, the (classical) two-tower approach has yielded robust uncertainty estimates, but care must be taken to meet the often competing requirements of statistical independence (non-overlapping footprints) and ecosystem homogeneity when choosing an appropriate tower distance. The role of the tower distance was investigated with help of a roving station separated between 8 m and 34 km from a permanent EC grassland station. Random uncertainty was estimated for five separation distances with the classical two-tower approach and an extended approach which removed systematic differences of CO2 fluxes measured at two EC towers. This analysis was made for a data set where (i) only similar weather conditions at the two sites were included, and (ii) an unfiltered one. The extended approach, applied to weather-filtered data for separation distances of 95 and 173 m gave uncertainty estimates in best correspondence with an independent reference method. The introduced correction for systematic flux differences considerably reduced the overestimation of the two-tower based uncertainty of net CO2 flux measurements and decreased the sensitivity of results to tower distance. We therefore conclude that corrections for systematic flux differences (e.g., caused by different environmental conditions at both EC towers) can help to apply the two-tower approach to more site pairs with less ideal conditions.},

abstract = {Biological and physical controls regulating variation of seasonal and interannual ecosystem carbon exchange in a scrub oak ecosystem in central Florida were determined by measuring net ecosystem exchange of CO2(NEE) between the atmosphere and vegetation using the eddy covariance technique continuously for 6 years (April 2000-March 2006). Total net ecosystem production (NEP) was nearly 20 t C m-2during the 6-year study and annual NEP for each phenological year (April-March) increased annually from 107 to 467 g C m-2year-1. Although this ecosystem was productive during all parts of each year, greatest absolute values of daytime NEE (NEEday max) were -12.0 to -16.0 $\mu$mol CO2m-2s-1in the summertime when leaf area, air temperature and soil moisture peaked. NEEday maxdecreased in magnitude to its lowest point in March when leaf area was lowest, and ranged between -7.6 and -9.8 $\mu$mol CO2m-2s-1. Mean monthly nighttime NEE (NEEnight) was between 2.0 and 6.9 $\mu$mol CO2m-2s-1in the winter and summer, respectively, and was controlled primarily by temperature. Variation in seasonal NEP in this ecosystem occurred in three distinct phases. The first phase occurred in April through May with the emergence of new leaves and when soil respiration was low; daily carbon assimilation (1.0-2.4 g C m-2day-1) was greatest during this 2-month period during which an average 38{\%} of annual C assimilation occurred. During the second phase, June-September, the rate of carbon uptake (0.8-1.6 g C m-2day-1) was dependent mainly on variation in temperature, precipitation and VPD; on average, only 12{\%} of annual carbon assimilation occurred during these 4 months and in dry years (2000 and 2001), the ecosystem was a carbon source during this period. During the third phase, October-March, daily carbon assimilation (0.3-1.1 g C m-2day-1) was intermediate between the first two phases, and accounted for nearly 50{\%} of annual carbon accumulated during these 6 months. While mean daily NEP was highest in spring, NEEdayreached its greatest intensity in summer. In order of importance, PPFD, temperature, SWC, LAI, and VPD regulated NEEday. Temperature and SWC were the main environmental variables controlling soil respiration, which was more than 85{\%} of ecosystem respiration. Scrub oak represents a unique ecosystem in the southeastern US and within the Ameriflux network. These results are unique in establishing the role scrub oak plays in landscape and regional carbon budgets of this subtropical, evergreen, fire dependent and highly active ecosystem. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is influenced by land use and management. Here, the carbon (CO2-C) budgets of a managed forest (spruce), a grass site and a crop site (crop rotation) have been compared to examine the effects of different management practices on net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and net biome productivity (NBP). This approach enables a more comprehensive carbon budgeting as it takes into account carbon exports and imports for particular land uses. Based on NEE measured with the eddy covariance (EC) method, we quantified NBP by also considering the carbon exports due to thinning or harvest and the carbon imports due to organic fertilisation. The sites are part of the Tharandt cluster in eastern Germany, characterised as having only slight differences in weather and climate. As a result, the management effects on the C budgets can be distinguished from other drivers. For the forest site, continuous CO2 flux measurements are available from 1997 to today, and the common study period of the grassland and cropland sites is 2005-2008 (one crop rotation). Only when considering the forest's annual NEE was there a variability in the net sink from -698gCm-2 (1999) to -444gCm-2 (2003), whereas the grassland and cropland sites exhibited small sinks between -177gCm-2 (2004) and -62gCm-2 (2005) and between -115gCm-2 (2005) and -32gCm-2 (2007 and 2008), respectively. The forest site is a carbon source with an NBP +221gCm-2 in 2002 because ???43m3ha-1 solid wood was removed. The grassland alternated between carbon sources and sinks, with NBP ranging from +25gCm-2 (2008) to -28gCm-2 (2006) due to carbon export through several cuts per year. The cropland site was mainly influenced by the cultivated crop species and the application of organic fertiliser (manure), resulting in NBP values between +484gCm-2 (2007) and -89gCm-2 (2006). The different timing and length of the growing season for winter and spring crops result in different intra-annual patterns of NEE as well as lower annual net CO2 sinks for the spring crops. Alternative accounting periods have been defined for all sites starting immediately after the harvest date at the crop site. Based on the full crop rotation period (around 4 years), the NBP showed a C sink for the spruce site and a C source for the crop rotation. The grass site was C neutral according to the calculated NBP. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The importance of ecological management for reducing the vulnerability of biodiversity to climate change is increasingly recognized, yet frameworks to facilitate a structured approach to climate adaptation management are lacking. We developed a conceptual framework that can guide identification of climate change impacts and adaptive management options in a given region or biome. The framework focuses on potential points of early climate change impact, and organizes these along two main axes. First, it recognizes that climate change can act at a range of ecological scales. Secondly, it emphasizes that outcomes are dependent on two potentially interacting and countervailing forces: (1) changes to environmental parameters and ecological processes brought about by climate change, and (2) responses of component systems as determined by attributes of resistance and resilience. Through this structure, the framework draws together a broad range of ecological concepts, with a novel emphasis on attributes of resistance and resilience that can temper the response of species, ecosystems and landscapes to climate change. We applied the framework to the world's largest remaining Mediterranean-climate woodland, the 'Great Western Woodlands' of south-western Australia. In this relatively intact region, maintaining inherent resistance and resilience by preventing anthropogenic degradation is of highest priority and lowest risk. Limited, higher risk options such as fire management, protection of refugia and translocation of adaptive genes may be justifiable under more extreme change, hence our capacity to predict the extent of change strongly impinges on such management decisions. These conclusions may contrast with similar analyses in degraded landscapes, where natural integrity is already compromised, and existing investment in restoration may facilitate experimentation with higher risk options.},

abstract = {Ecosystem respiration, arising from soil decomposition as well as from plant maintenance and growth, has been shown to be the most important component of carbon exchange in most terrestrial ecosystems. The goal of this study was to estimate the growth component of whole-ecosystem respiration in a Mediterranean evergreen oak (Quercus ilex) forest over the course of 3 years. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was determined from night-time carbon dioxide flux (F-c) using eddy correlation when friction velocity (u(*)) was greater than 0.35 m s(-1) We postulated that growth respiration could be evaluated as a residual after removing modeled base R-eco from whole-ecosystem R-eco during periods when growth was most likely occurring. We observed that the model deviated from the night-time F-c-based R-eco during the period from early February to early July with the largest discrepancies occurring at the end of May, coinciding with budburst when active aboveground growth and radial growth increment are greatest. The highest growth respiration rates were observed in 2001 with daily fluxes reaching up to 4 g C m(-2). The cumulative growth respiration for the entire growth period gave total carbon losses of 170, 208, and 142 g C m(-2) for 1999, 2001, and 2002, respectively. Biochemical analysis of soluble carbohydrates, starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins, lignin, and lipids for leaves and stems allowed calculation of the total construction costs of the different growth components, which yielded values of 154, 200, and 150 g C for 3 years, respectively, corresponding well to estimated growth respiration. Estimates of both leaf and stem growth showed very large interannual variation, although average growth respiration coefficients and average yield of growth processes were fairly constant over the 3 years and close to literature values. The time course of the growth respiration may be explained by the growth pattern of leaves and stems and by cambial activity. This approach has potential applications for interpreting the effects of climate variation, disturbances, and management practices on growth and ecosystem respiration.},

abstract = {The Southern Great Plains are characterized by a fine-scale mixture of different land-cover types, predominantly winter-wheat and grazed pasture, with relatively small areas of other crops, native prairie, and switchgrass. Recent droughts and predictions of increased drought in the Southern Great Plains, especially during the summer months, raise concern for these ecosystems. We measured ecosystem carbon and water fluxes with eddy-covariance systems over cultivated cropland for 10 years, and over lightly grazed prairie and new switchgrass fields for 2 years each. Growing-season precipitation showed the strongest control over net carbon uptake for all ecosystems, but with a variable effect: grasses (prairie and switchgrass) needed at least 350. mm of precipitation during the growing season to become net carbon sinks, while crops needed only 100. mm. In summer, high temperatures enhanced evaporation and led to higher likelihood of dry soil conditions. Therefore, summer-growing native prairie species and switchgrass experienced more seasonal droughts than spring-growing crops. For wheat, the net reduction in carbon uptake resulted mostly from a decrease in gross primary production rather than an increase in respiration. Flux measurements suggested that management practices for crops were effective in suppressing evapotranspiration and decomposition (by harvesting and removing secondary growth), and in increasing carbon uptake (by fertilizing and conserving summer soil water). In light of future projections for wetter springs and drier and warmer summers in the Southern Great Plains, our study indicates an increased vulnerability in native ecosystems and summer crops over time.},

abstract = {Two years of continuous measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using the eddy covariance technique were made over a Mediterranean alpine shrubland. This ecosystem was found to be a net source of CO2 (+ 52 +/- 7 g C m(-2) and + 48 +/- 7 g C m(-2) for 2007 and 2008) during the two-year study period. To understand the reasons underlying this net release of CO2 into the atmosphere, we analysed the drivers of seasonal variability in NEE over these two years. We observed that the soil water availability - driven by the precipitation pattern - and the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) are the key factors for understanding both the carbon sequestration potential and the duration of the photosynthetic period during the growing season. Finally, the effects of the self-heating correction to CO2 and H2O fluxes measured with the open-path infrared gas analyser were evaluated. Applying the correction turned the annual CO2 budget in 2007 from a sink (-135 +/- 7 g C m(-2)) to a source (+ 52 +/- 7 g C m(-2)). The magnitude of this change is larger than reported previously and is shown to be due to the low air density and cold temperatures at this high elevation study site.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the annual variation of soil respiration and its components in relation to seasonal changes in soil temperature and soil moisture in a Mediterranean mixed oak forest ecosystem, we set up a series of experimental treatments in May 1999 where litter (no litter), roots (no roots, by trenching) or both were excluded from plots of 4 m(2) . Subsequently, we measured soil respiration, soil temperature and soil moisture in each plot over a year after the forest was coppiced. The treatments did not significantly affect soil temperature or soil moisture measured over 0-10 cm depth.  Soil respiration varied markedly during the year with high rates in spring and autumn and low rates in summer, coinciding with summer drought, and in winter, with the lowest temperatures. Very high respiration rates, however, were observed during the summer immediately after rainfall events. The mean annual rate of soil respiration was 2.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) , ranging from 1.35 to 7.03 mumol m(-2) s(-1) .  Soil respiration was highly correlated with temperature during winter and during spring and autumn whenever volumetric soil water content was above 20{\%}. Below this threshold value, there was no correlation between soil respiration and soil temperature, but soil moisture was a good predictor of soil respiration. A simple empirical model that predicted soil respiration during the year, using both soil temperature and soil moisture accounted for more than 91{\%} of the observed annual variation in soil respiration.  All the components of soil respiration followed a similar seasonal trend and were affected by summer drought. The Q (10) value for soil respiration was 2.32, which is in agreement with other studies in forest ecosystems. However, we found a Q (10) value for root respiration of 2.20, which is lower than recent values reported for forest sites. The fact that the seasonal variation in root growth with temperature in Mediterranean ecosystems differs from that in temperate regions may explain this difference. In temperate regions, increases in size of root populations during the growing season, coinciding with high temperatures, may yield higher apparent Q (10) values than in Mediterranean regions where root growth is suppressed by summer drought.  The decomposition of organic matter and belowground litter were the major components of soil respiration, accounting for almost 55{\%} of the total soil respiration flux. This proportion is higher than has been reported for mature boreal and temperate forest and is probably the result of a short-term C loss following recent logging at the site.  The relationship proposed for soil respiration with soil temperature and soil moisture is useful for understanding and predicting potential changes in Mediterranean forest ecosystems in response to forest management and climate change.

abstract = {Changes in the hydrological cycle, as predicted and currently observed, are expected to significantly impact the water and carbon balance of water-limited forest ecosystems. However, differences in the water-sensitivity of component processes make carbon balance predictions challenging. To examine responses of ecosystem components to water limitations, we conducted a study of tree, soil and ecosystem-level processes in a young ponderosa pine stand under natural summer drought (control) and increased soil water conditions (watered). Weekly-averaged tree transpiration (Ttree), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GPP) and soil CO2efflux (Rstree; nearby trees) were related with soil water content (SWC; polynomial form: TtreeR2=0.98 and RstreeR2=0.91, logarithmic form: GPP R2=0.86) and declined rapidly when relative extractable soil water (REW) was {\textless}50{\%}. The sensitivity of daily variations in canopy conductance (Gs) to vapor pressure deficit was affected by SWC (R2=0.97; logarithmic function), decreasing at REW {\textless}50{\%}. Watering maintained REW at about 70{\%} in July and August but positively affected tree carbon and water dynamics only at the end of summer when fluxes in the control treatment were strongly water-limited. A tight coupling of above- and belowground fluxes became apparent. In the control treatment, root-rhizosphere respiration (Rr) decreased along with GPP and Ttree(R2=0.58) as drought progressed, while watering maintained Rr, Ttreeand Gsat a significantly higher level than those of the unwatered trees in late summer. In contrast, microbial respiration responded instantaneously and strongly to the watering compared to the control treatment. The net effect was that increased soil water availability during the typical dry growing season has a negative effect on the short-term seasonal ecosystem C balance due to a larger increase in decomposition than photosynthesis. However, longer-term effects remain uncertain. In summary, our study highlights that understanding the dissimilar response of tree dynamics and soil decomposition to water availability is a key component in predicting future C sequestration in water-limited forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The production of bioenergy in Europe is one of the strategies conceived to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The suitability of the land use change from a cropland (REF site) to a short rotation coppice plantation of hybrid poplar (SRC site) was investigated by comparing the GHG budgets of these two systems over 24 months in Viterbo, Italy. Eddy covariance measurements were carried out to quantify the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (FCO2), whereas chambers were used to measure N2O and CH4 emissions from soil. Soil organic carbon (SOC) of an older poplar plantation was used to estimate via a regression the SOC loss due to SRC establishment. Emissions from tractors and from production and transport of agricultural inputs (FMAN) were modelled and GHG emission offset due to fossil fuel substitution was credited to the SRC site considering the C intensity of natural gas. Emissions due to the use of the biomass (FEXP) were also considered. The suitability was finally assessed comparing the GHG budgets of the two sites. FCO2 was the higher flux in the SRC site (−3512 ± 224 g CO2 eq m−2 in two years), while in the REF site it was −1838 ± 107 g CO2 m−2 in two years. FEXP was equal to 1858 ± 240 g CO2 m−2 in 24 months in the REF site, thus basically compensating FCO2, while it was 1118 ± 521 g CO2 eq m−2 in 24 months in the SRC site. This latter could offset −379.7 ± 175.1 g CO2 eq m−2 from fossil fuel displacement. Soil CH4 and N2O fluxes were negligible. FMAN weighed 2 and 4{\%} in the GHG budgets of SRC and REF sites respectively, while the SOC loss weighed 455 ± 524 g CO2 m−2 in two years. Overall, the REF site was close to neutrality in a GHG perspective (156 ± 264 g CO2 eq m−2), while the SRC site was a net sink of −2202 ± 792 g CO2 eq m−2. In conclusion the experiment led to a positive evaluation of the conversion of cropland to bioenergy SRC from a GHG viewpoint.},

Hence, there is a growing interest in analyzing and understanding carbon fluxes from arable land as affected by regional environmental as well as management conditions. The major goal of this study is to use a two year data set of eddy covariance measurements (October 2007 to October 2009) on a winter wheat field located in Western Germany to assess the seasonal and inter-annual variability of carbon fluxes as affected by meteorological variables and land management. During the study period, which was comprised of two full growing seasons, eddy covariance measurements together with measurements of various soil, plant, and meteorological data were performed. Flux partitioning and gap filling methods including uncertainty estimates were applied to derive complete time series of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), gross primary production (GPP), and ecosystem respiration (Reco). Despite different management dates and slightly different meteorological conditions, annual NEE resulted in 270gCm-2in both years. Although the period from sowing to harvesting was more than 20 days shorter in the first year, due to the later start of senescence, GPP was higher by 220gCm-2. In the annual carbon budget this was compensated by a stronger heterotrophic respiration after the harvest of sugar beet grown on the field before the study period. Taking into account the carbon losses due to removal of biomass during harvest, the winter wheat field acts as a carbon source with respective net biome productivities (NBP) of 246 and 201gCm-2a-1. To complete the carbon balance, releases due to energy consumption associated with crop production are taken into account. However, the relatively large carbon loss was probably, to a large extent, compensated by carbon input from plant residues left on the field after preceding sugar beet harvest. This underlines the importance of multi-annual measurements taking full crop rotations into account. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Global-scale studies indicate that semiarid regions strongly regulate the terrestrial carbon sink. However, we lack understanding of how climatic shifts, such as decadal drought, impact carbon sequestration across the wide range of structural diversity in semiarid ecosystems. Therefore, we used eddy covariance measurements to quantify how net ecosystem production of carbon dioxide (NEP) differed with relative grass and woody plant abundance over the last decade of drought in four Southwest U.S. ecosystems. We identified a precipitation pivot point in the carbon balance for each ecosystem where annual NEP switched from negative to positive. Ecosystems with grass had pivot points closer to the drought period precipitation than the predrought average, making them more likely to be carbon sinks (and a grass-free shrubland, a carbon source) during the current drought. One reason for this is that the grassland located closest to the shrubland supported higher leaf area and photosynthesis at the same water availability. Higher leaf area was associated with a greater proportion of evapotranspiration being transpiration (T/ET), and therefore with higher ecosystem water use efficiency (gross ecosystem photosynthesis/ET). Our findings strongly show that water availability is a primary driver of both gross and net semiarid productivity and illustrate that structural differences may contribute to the speed at which ecosystem carbon cycling adjusts to climatic shifts.},

abstract = {Global warming may intensify the hydrological cycle and lead to increased drought severity and duration, which could alter plant community structure and subsequent ecosystem water and carbon dioxide cycling. We report on the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) of a semidesert grassland through a severe drought which drove succession from native bunchgrasses to forbs and to eventual dominance by an exotic bunchgrass. We monitored NEE and energy fluxes using eddy covariance coupled with meteorological and soil moisture variables for 6 years at a grassland site in southeastern Arizona, USA. Seasonal NEE typically showed a springtime carbon uptake after winter-spring periods of average rainfall followed by much stronger sink activity during the summer rainy season. The two severe drought years (2004 and 2005) resulted in a net release of carbon dioxide (25 g C m{\&}{\#}8722;2) and widespread mortality of native perennial bunchgrasses. Above average summer rains in 2006 alleviated drought conditions, resulting in a large flush of broad-leaved forbs and negative total NEE ({\&}{\#}8722;55 g C m{\&}{\#}8722;2 year{\&}{\#}8722;1). Starting in 2007 and continuing through 2009, the ecosystem became increasingly dominated by the exotic grass, Eragrostis lehmanniana, and was a net carbon sink ({\&}{\#}8722;47 to {\&}{\#}8722;98 g C m{\&}{\#}8722;2 year{\&}{\#}8722;1) but with distinct annual patterns in NEE. Rainfall mediated by soils was the key driver to water and carbon fluxes. Seasonal respiration and photosynthesis were strongly dependent on precipitation, but photosynthesis was more sensitive to rainfall variation. Respiration normalized by evapotranspiration showed no interannual variation, while normalized gross ecosystem production (i.e., water use efficiency) was low during drought years and then increased as the rains returned and the E. lehmanniana invasion progressed. Thus, when dry summer conditions returned in 2009, the potential for ecosystem carbon accumulation was increased and the ecosystem remained a net sink unlike similar dry years when native grasses dominated ecosystem structure.},

abstract = {Annual precipitation in the central and southern warm-desert region of North America is distributed climatologically between summer and winter periods with two prominent dry periods between them. We used energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes from eddy covariance along with standard meteorological and soil moisture measurements at a semiarid savanna in southern Arizona, United States, to better understand the consequences of warm or cool season drought on ecosystem CO2 exchange in these bimodally forced water-limited regions. Over the last 100 years, this historic grassland has converted to a savanna by the encroachment of the native mesquite tree (Prosopis velutina Woot.). During each of the 4 years of observation (2004–2007), annual precipitation (P) was below average, but monsoon (July–September) P was both above and below average while cool-season (December–March) P was always less than average by varying degrees. The ecosystem was a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, ranging from 14 to 95 g C m−2 yr−1 with the strength of the source increasing with decreasing precipitation. When the rainfall was closest to the long-term average in its distribution and amount, the ecosystem was essentially carbon neutral. Summer drought resulted in increased carbon losses due mainly to a shortening of the growing season and the length of time later in the season when photosynthetic gain exceeds respiration loss. Severe cool season drought led to decreased spring carbon uptake and seemingly enhanced summer respiration, resulting in conditions that led to the greatest annual net carbon loss.},

abstract = {This study presents the interannual CO2 exchange of a semiarid shrubland overlying a carbonaceous substrate where abiotic processes may interact with biological processes in the ecosystem carbon cycle. Estimated by the eddy covariance technique and two different gap-filling models (RBF neural network and MDS ``Marginal Distribution Sampling''), the mean annual net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 varied from -63 to 29 g C m(-2), averaging -2 +/- 23 g C m(-2) from May 2004 to December 2007. In addition, CO2 exchange was divided into periods likely dominated by clear signals of biological activity (high daytime uptake, low Bowen ratio) and periods of apparent plant senescence (dry conditions) to better understand the relative contributions of ``biological versus abiotic processes'' to the annual NEE and the interannual variability of these processes. During biological periods, CO2 exchange appears to be related to changes in the ecosystem leaf area index, whereas abiotic fluxes are most closely related to evapotranspiration. The timing of rainfall events seems to be a main determinant of both activation and duration of biological processes. During apparent abiotic periods, CO2 exchange is characterized by daytime emissions averaging 1.5 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), whereas biological periods are characterized by daytime CO2 uptake with mean values of around 1.4 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). As a preliminary result, the abiotic period characterized from 19{\%} of 2004 to 45{\%} of 2007 with a mean duration of approximately 2 months. However, future research is needed in order to achieve a more reliable division between determinant processes involved in CO2 exchange over carbonaceous substrates.},

However, there is no information on the effect of burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance. Here, we examine for the first time the effect of post-fire burnt wood management on the net ecosystem carbon balance by comparing the carbon exchange of two treatments in a burnt Mediterranean coniferous forest treated by salvage logging (SL, felling and removing the logs and masticating the woody debris) and Non-Intervention (NI, all trees left standing) using eddy covariance measurements. Using different partitioning approaches, we analyze the evolution of photosynthesis and respiration processes together with measurements of vegetation cover and soil respiration and humidity to interpret the differences in the measured fluxes and underlying processes. Results show that SL enhanced CO2emissions of this burnt pine forest by more than 120gCm-2compared to the NI treatment for the period June-December 2009. Although soil respiration was around 30{\%} higher in NI during growing season, this was more than offset by photosynthesis, as corroborated by increases in vegetation cover and evapotranspiration. Since SL is counterproductive to climate-change and Kyoto protocol objectives of optimal C sequestration by terrestrial ecosystems, less aggressive burnt wood management policies should be considered. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Quantifying the surface energy fluxes of grazed and ungrazed steppes is essential to understand the roles of grasslands in local and global climate and in land use change. We used paired eddy-covariance towers to investigate the effects of grazing on energy balance (EB) components: net radiation (Rn), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H), and soil heat (G) fluxes on adjacent grazed and ungrazed areas in a desert steppe of the Mongolian Plateau for a two-year period (2010–2012). Near 95{\%} of Rn was partitioned as LE and H, whereas the contributions of G and other components of the EB were 5{\%} at an annual scale. H dominated the energy partitioning and shared {\~{}}50{\%} of Rn. When comparing the grazed and the ungrazed desert steppe, there was remarkably lower Rn and a lower H, but higher G at the grazed site than at the ungrazed site. Both reduced available energy (Rn − G) and H indicated a “cooling effect” feedback onto the local climate through grazing. Grazing reduced the dry year LE but enhanced the wet year LE. Energy partitioning of LE/Rn was positively correlated with the canopy conductivity, leaf area index, and soil moisture. H/Rn was positively correlated with the vapor pressure deficit but negatively correlated with the soil moisture. Boosted regression tree results showed that LE/Rn was dominated by soil moisture in both years and at both sites, while grazing shifted the H/Rn domination from temperature to soil moisture in the wet year. Grazing not only caused an LE shift between the dry and the wet year, but also triggered a decrease in the H/Rn because of changes in vegetation and soil properties, indicating that the ungrazed area had a greater resistance while the grazed area had a greater sensitivity of EB components to the changing climate.},

Eddy covariance technique was used to measure NEE, biotic and abiotic factors for nearly 3 years in the hinterland alpine steppe-Korbresia meadow grassland on the Tibetan Plateau, the present highest fluxnet station in the world. The main objectives are to investigate dynamics of NEE and its components and to determine the major controlling factors. Maximum carbon assimilation took place in August and maximum carbon loss occurred in November. In June, rainfall amount due to monsoon climate played a great role in grass greening and consequently influenced interannual variation of ecosystem carbon gain. From July through September, monthly NEE presented net carbon assimilation. In other months, ecosystem exhibited carbon loss. In growing season, daytime NEE was mainly controlled by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). In addition, leaf area index (LAI) interacted with PAR and together modulated NEE rates. Ecosystem respiration was controlled mainly by soil temperature and simultaneously by soil moisture. Q10 was negatively correlated with soil temperature but positively correlated with soil moisture. Large daily range of air temperature is not necessary to enhance carbon gain. Standard respiration rate at referenced 10°C (R10) was positively correlated with soil moisture, soil temperature, LAI and aboveground biomass. Rainfall patterns in growing season markedly influenced soil moisture and therefore soil moisture controlled seasonal change of ecosystem respiration. Pulse rainfall in the beginning and at the end of growing season induced great ecosystem respiration and consequently a great amount of carbon was lost. Short growing season and relative low temperature restrained alpine grass vegetation development. The results suggested that LAI be usually in a low level and carbon uptake be relatively low. Rainfall patterns in the growing season and pulse rainfall in the beginning and at end of growing season control ecosystem respiration and consequently influence carbon balance of ecosystem. {\textcopyright} Science in China Press 2006.},

Eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange were compared with measured CO2 fluxes at two nearby forests in order to distinguish wetland effects from regional trends. As wetland water table declined, both ecosystem respiration and ecosystem production increased by over 20{\%} at the wetland, while forest CO2 fluxes had no significant trends. Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide at the wetland was not correlated with water table, but wetland evapotranspiration decreased substantially as the water table declined.

This article describes the environment and the ecosystem properties of the site using a unique set of in situ data. The studied variables include hydroclimatic variables, species composition, albedo, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), hyperspectral characteristics (350-1800 nm), surface reflectance anisotropy, brightness temperature, fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FAPAR), biomass, vegetation water content, and land-atmosphere exchanges of carbon (NEE) and energy.

This makes the site suitable for investigating relationships between ecosystem properties and hydroclimatic variables for semiarid savanna ecosystems of the region. There were strong interannual, seasonal and diurnal dynamics in NEE, with high values of {\~{}}-7.5 g C m(-2)  day(-1) during the peak of the growing season. We found neither browning nor greening NDVI trends from 2002 to 2012. Interannual variation in species composition was strongly related to rainfall distribution. NDVI and FAPAR were strongly related to species composition, especially for years dominated by the species Zornia glochidiata. This influence was not observed in interannual variation in biomass and vegetation productivity, thus challenging dryland productivity models based on remote sensing. Surface reflectance anisotropy (350-1800 nm) at the peak of the growing season varied strongly depending on wavelength and viewing angle thereby having implications for the design of remotely sensed spectral vegetation indices covering different wavelength regions. The presented time series of in situ data have great potential for dryland dynamics studies, global climate change related research and evaluation and parameterization of remote sensing products and dynamic vegetation models.},

abstract = {To assess the variation of soil respiration at different forest stages we measured it in a coppiced oak (Quercus cerris L.) chronosequence in central Italy during two campaigns, spanning 2 successive years, in four stands at different stages of the rotation: 1 year (S1), 5 years (S5), 10 years (S10) and 17 years (S17) after coppicing. The contribution of the different components of soil respiration flux (aboveground litter, belowground decomposition soil organic matter and root respiration) was estimated by a paired comparison of manipulative experiments between the recently coppiced stand (S1) and mature stand (S17). Ninety percent of soil respiration values were between 1.7 and 7.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), with an overall mean (+/- SD) of 4.0 +/- 2.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Spatial variation of soil respiration was high (CV=44.9{\%}), with a mean range (i.e. patch size) of 4.8 +/- 2.7 m, as estimated from a semivariance analysis. In the absence of limitation by soil moisture, soil respiration was related to soil temperature with the exponential Q(10) model (average Q(10)=2.25). During summer, soil moisture constrained soil respiration and masked its dependence on soil temperature. Soil respiration declined over the years after coppicing. Assuming a linear decline with stand age, we estimated a reduction of 24{\%} over a 20-year-rotation cycle. The response of soil respiration to temperature also changed with age of the stands: the Q(10) was estimated to decrease from 2.90 in S1 to 2.42 in S17, suggesting that different components or processes may be involved at different developmental stages. The contribution of heterotrophic respiration to total soil respiration flux was relatively larger in the young S1 stand than in the mature S17 stand.},

abstract = {In this work, eddy covariance data from a northern boreal Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) stand were used in the parametrization of two up-scaled leaf-level photosynthesis models. The parametrization was carried out by eddy covariance data inversion. The biochemically based Farquhar model parameters, the maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax) and maximum rate of carboxylation [Vc(max)], were both obtained from the temperature responses measured by the eddy covariance. The semi-empirical model, based on optimizing water use and carbon gain, was parametrized according to the seasonal behaviour of the parameter 03B2. The parametrization of the models was performed for the year 2001, while 2002 was used as a test year to study the models' capabilities. Both of the models tracked daily CO2 assimilation fairly well, reaching the high growing-season rates in mid-June and starting the autumn drawdown at the beginning of September. The incapability of the models to track the diminishing of CO2 fluxes during very dry days brings up the issue of combining a soil model into the canopy model. The biochemical model parameters have temperature responses that change during the growing season. The biochemical model responds more to the temperature, whereas the semi-empirical model is strongly driven by the light level.},

abstract = {Turbulence data measured with fast response instruments at two sites with distinct conditions were available. The ability of a mesoscale model in the simulation of turbulent fluxes and boundary layer height was assessed in case studies covering periods in the Southern Hemisphere summer and winter. The energy apportionment at both locations was properly reproduced. In summer, at the site with native forest, the sensible heat flux was well estimated and the latent heat flux was underestimated. At the other site (commercial plantation) the sensible heat flux was properly represented and the latent heat flux was slightly overestimated. In winter, the best results were obtained at the implanted forest site. The performance of the model at the native forest site was very satisfactory when homogeneous initial soil moisture was considered. A model intercomparison between the boundary layer height obtained with an analytical model and the mesoscale model showed the influence of data and methodologies used in the two approaches. {\textcopyright} 2015 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Annual net uptake of CO2 ranged from 1.0 to 4.7 Mg-C ha?1yr?1, with an average of 2.5 Mg-C ha?1yr?1. Uptake rates increased systematically, nearly doubling over the period despite forest age of 75–110 years; there were parallel increases in midsummer photosynthetic capacity at high light level (21.5?31.5 mmole m?2s?1), woody biomass (101?115 Mg-C ha?1 from 1993?2005, mostly due to growth of one species, red oak), and peak leaf area index (4.5?5.5 from 1998–2005). The long-term trends were interrupted in 1998 by sharp declines in photosynthetic capacity, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) ofCO2, and other parameters, with recovery over the next 3 years. The observations were compared to empirical functions giving the mean responses to temperature and light, and to a terrestrial ecosystem model (IBIS2). Variations in gross ecosystem exchange of CO2 (GEE) and NEE on hourly to monthly timescales were represented well as prompt responses to the environment, but interannual variations and long-term trends were not. IBIS2 simulated mean annual NEE, but greatly overpredicted the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and did not predict the decadal trend. The drivers of interannual and decadal changes in NEE are long-term increases in tree biomass, successional change in forest composition, and disturbance events,},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes were measured at a tundra site near Chokurdakh, in the lowlands of the Indigirka river in north-east Siberia. This site is one of the few stations on Russian tundra and it is different from most other tundra flux stations in its continentality. A suite of methods was applied to determine the fluxes of NEE, GPP, R-eco and methane, including eddy covariance, chambers and leaf cuvettes. Net carbon dioxide fluxes were high compared with other tundra sites, with NEE=-92 g C m(-2) yr(-1), which is composed of an R-eco=+141 g C m(-2) yr(-1) and GPP=-232 g C m(-2) yr(-1). This large carbon dioxide sink may be explained by the continental climate, that is reflected in low winter soil temperatures (-14 degrees C), reducing the respiration rates, and short, relatively warm summers, stimulating high photosynthesis rates. Interannual variability in GPP was dominated by the frequency of light limitation (R-g{\textless}200 W m(-2)), whereas R-eco depends most directly on soil temperature and time in the growing season, which serves as a proxy of the combined effects of active layer depth, leaf area index, soil moisture and substrate availability. The methane flux, in units of global warming potential, was +28 g C-CO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1), so that the greenhouse gas balance was -64 g C-CO(2)e m(-2) yr(-1). Methane fluxes depended only slightly on soil temperature and were highly sensitive to hydrological conditions and vegetation composition.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide exchange was quantified in maize-soybean agroecosystems employing year-round tower eddy covariance flux systems and measurements of soil C stocks, CO2fluxes from the soil surface, plant biomass, and litter decomposition. Measurements were made in three cropping systems: (a) irrigated continuous maize, (b) irrigated maize-soybean rotation, and (c) rainfed maize-soybean rotation during 2001-2004. Because of a variable cropping history, all three sites were uniformly tilled by disking prior to initiation of the study. Since then, all sites are under no-till, and crop and soil management follow best management practices prescribed for production-scale systems. Cumulative daily gain of C by the crops (from planting to physiological maturity), determined from the measured eddy covariance CO2fluxes and estimated heterotrophic respiration, compared well with the measured total above and belowground biomass. Two contrasting features of maize and soybean CO2exchange are notable. The value of integrated GPP (gross primary productivity) for both irrigated and rainfed maize over the growing season was substantially larger (ca. 2:1 ratio) than that for soybean. Also, soybean lost a larger portion (0.80-0.85) of GPP as ecosystem respiration (due, in part, to the large amount of maize residue from the previous year), as compared to maize (0.55-0.65). Therefore, the seasonally integrated NEP (net ecosystem production) in maize was larger by a 4:1 ratio (approximately), as compared to soybean. Enhanced soil moisture conditions in the irrigated maize and soybean fields caused an increase in ecosystem respiration, thus eliminating any advantage of increased GPP and giving about the same values for the growing season NEP as the rainfed fields. On an annual basis, the NEP of irrigated continuous maize was 517, 424, and 381 g C m-2year-1, respectively, during the 3 years of our study. In rainfed maize the annual NEP was 510 and 397 g C m-2year-1in years 1 and 3, respectively. The annual NEP in the irrigated and rainfed soybean fields were in the range of -18 to -48 g C m-2. Accounting for the grain C removed during harvest and the CO2released from irrigation water, our tower eddy covariance flux data over the first 3 years suggest that, at this time: (a) the rainfed maize-soybean rotation system is C neutral, (b) the irrigated continuous maize is nearly C neutral or a slight source of C, and (c) the irrigated maize-soybean rotation is a moderate source of C. Direct measurement of soil C stocks could not detect a statistically significant change in soil organic carbon during the first 3 years of no-till farming in these three cropping systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The perturbation timescale-dependences of the CO2flux and the random flux sampling error are evaluated from eddy-covariance tower observations in the mid-day convective boundary layer over mid-latitude conifer forests. The perturbation timescale is the timescale used in the standard Reynolds decomposition to define mean and perturbations quantities. The random error due to inadequate sampling of the turbulence is estimated using two different approaches (traditional and daily-differencing). A fixed record length of 3.6 h (dyadic timescale) is used for all results, where the record length is the timescale over which the products of perturbations are averaged (flux averaging timescale). Long multiple-hour records are required to evaluate the sampling errors. When high temporal resolution flux estimates are of interest (e.g., sub-daily timescales), including incremental contributions to the flux from transport on timescales longer than 10 min cannot be justified based on the magnitude of the incremental increase in the random sampling error. That is, the additional flux obtained by increasing the perturbation timescale beyond 10 min is dominated by random sampling error. This result is supported by both the traditional and daily-differencing approaches. For a perturbation timescale of 30 min, the relative random error (random error divided by the flux) is 38{\%} at the taller tower and 27{\%} at the shorter tower, and increases with increasing perturbation timescale. The cost associated with reducing the random error by using the shorter 10 min perturbation timescale, compared to the standard practice of 30 min, is an increase in the systematic flux error from 3{\%} to 7{\%} (averaged over three sites). Such error, while systematic, may be small in comparison to other sources of uncertainty. The choice of the perturbation timescale, and the trade-offs between reducing systematic or random errors, may depend on the intended application of the flux data. When only longer term flux estimates (e.g., monthly or annual averages) are of interest the random sampling error tends to cancel because of the larger number of samples, and the perturbation timescale can be increased to further reduce the systematic flux error. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In 2009, the reduced water supply during the early growing stage limited leaf area expansion, thus negatively affecting canopy photosynthesis. The variability of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R eco) was mainly explained by seasonal variation of leaf area index (LAI). The seasonal variation of R eco was positively influenced by soil temperatures (T soil) in 2008 but not in 2009. In 2008, a contribution of both autotrophic and heterotrophic components to total R eco could be hypothesized, while during 2009, autotrophic respiration is supposed to be the most important component.

Continuous measurements of carbon dioxide and water vapor exchange using the eddy covariance technique during 2003-2007 were made above a subtropical evergreen coniferous plantation in Southeast China. Seasonal distribution of precipitation and temperature was inconsistent during the summer, which resulted in droughts frequently. Gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem production (NEP) showed clear seasonality, with low rates during droughts and in winter. With statistical significance, the monthly GEP and RE increased exponentially with air temperature, but the monthly NEP was less sensitive and only increased linearly with air temperature. However, the function response of monthly NEP and its components (GEP and RE) disappeared under high temperature and low soil moisture. Monthly and yearly RE showed a statistically linear and positive dependence on the corresponding GEP. Annual NEP varied among years from 306 to 430 g C m(-2) (mean 395, SD 50). Interannual variability in NEP was controlled primarily by air temperature and the ratio of precipitation and evapotranspiration that affected the RE/GEP ratio, which varied between 0.76 and 0.81 (mean 0.78, SD 0.02).},

Continued monitoring of ecosystem productivity and phenology across temporal and spatial scales is a central part of assessing the magnitude of these changes. This study investigates the ability to use automatic digital camera images (DCIs) as proxy data for gross primary production (GPP) in a complex low Arctic wetland site. Vegetation greenness computed from DCIs was found to correlate significantly (R2=0.62, p{\textless}0.001) with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product derived from the WorldView-2 satellite. An object-based classification based on a bi-temporal image composite was used to classify the study area into heath, copse, fen, and bedrock. Temporal evolution of vegetation greenness was evaluated and modeled with double sigmoid functions for each plant community. GPP at light saturation modeled from eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements were found to correlate significantly with vegetation greenness for all plant communities in the studied year (i.e., 2010), and the highest correlation was found between modeled fen greenness and GPP (R2=0.85, p{\textless}0.001). Finally, greenness computed within modeled EC footprints were used to evaluate the influence of individual plant communities on the flux measurements. The study concludes that digital cameras may be used as a cost-effective proxy for potential GPP in remote Arctic regions. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Two undisturbed forest sites and 27 pasture sites of 0.5 to 60 years were sampled once each during wet and dry seasons. In addition to soil-atmosphere fluxes of N2O we measured 27 soil chemical, soil microbiological and soil physical variables. Soil N 2O fluxes were higher in the wet season than in the dry season. Fluxes of N2O from forest soils always exceeded fluxes from pasture soils and showed no consistent trend with pasture age. At our forest sites, nitrate was the dominant form of inorganic N both during wet and dry season. At our pasture sites nitrate generally dominated the inorganic N pools during the wet season and ammonium dominated during the dry season. Net mineralization and nitrification rates displayed large variations. During the dry season net immobilization of N was observed in some pastures. Compared to forest sites, young pasture sites (≤2 years) had low microbial biomass N and protease activities. Protease activity and microbial biomass N peaked in pastures of intermediate age (4 to 8 years) followed by consistently lower values in older pasture (10 to 60 years). The C/N ratio of litter was low at the forest sites (∼25) and rapidly increased with pasture age reaching values of 60-70 at pastures of 15 years and older. Nitrous oxide emissions at our sites were controlled by C and N availability and soil aeration. Fluxes of N2O were negatively correlated to leaf litter C/N ratio, NH4 +-N and the ratio of NO3 --N to the sum of NO3 --N + NH4 +-N (indicators of N availability), and methane fluxes and bulk density (indicators of soil aeration status) during the wet season. During the dry season fluxes of N2O were positively correlated to microbial biomass N, $\beta$-glucosidase activity, total inorganic N stocks and NH4 +-N. In our study region, pastures of all age emitted less N2O than old-growth forests, because of a progressive decline in N availability with pasture age combined with strongly anaerobic conditions in some pastures during the wet season.},

Eddy covariance CO2 flux data and associated measurements of the green plant area index and the major environmental driving forces acquired during 2001-2006 at the study site Neustift (Austria) were analyzed. Driven by three cutting events per year which kept the investigated grassland in a stage of vigorous growth, the seasonal variability of NEE was primarily modulated by gross primary productivity (GPP). The role of environmental parameters in modulating the seasonal variability of NEE was obscured by the strong response of GPP to changes in the amount of green plant area, as well as the cutting-mediated decoupling of phenological development and the seasonal course of environmental drivers. None of the environmental and management metrics examined was able to explain the inter-annual variability of annual NEE. This is thought to result from (1) a high covariance between GPP and ecosystem respiration (Reco) at the annual timescale which results in a comparatively small inter-annual variation of NEE, (2) compensating effects between carbon exchange during and outside the management period, and (3) changes in the biotic response to rather than the environmental variables per se. GPP was more important in modulating inter-annual variations in NEE in spring and before the first and second cut, while Reco explained a larger fraction of the inter-annual variability of NEE during the remaining periods, in particular the post-cut periods.},

abstract = {Abstract Tropical forest ecosystems play an important role in regulating the global climate, yet deforestation and land-use change mean that the tropical carbon sink is increasingly influenced by agroecosystems and pastures. Despite this, it is not yet fully understood how carbon cycling in the tropics responds to land-use change, particularly for pasture and afforestation. Thus, the objectives of our study were: (1) to elucidate the environmental controls and the impact of management on gross primary production (GPP), total ecosystem respiration (TER) and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE); (2) to estimate the carbon sequestration potential of tropical pasture compared with afforestation; and (3) to compare eddy covariance-derived carbon budgets with biomass and soil inventory data. We performed comparative measurements of NEE in a tropical C4 pasture and an adjacent afforestation with native tree species in Sardinilla (Panama) from 2007 to 2009. Pronounced seasonal variation in GPP, TER and NEE were closely related to radiation, soil moisture, and C3 vs. C4 plant physiology. The shallow rooting depth of grasses compared with trees resulted in a higher sensitivity of the pasture ecosystem to water limitation and seasonal drought. During 2008, substantial amounts of carbon were sequestered by the afforestation (G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}442-{\'{a}}g-{\'{a}}C-{\'{a}}mG{\c{C}}{\^{o}}2, negative values denote ecosystem carbon uptake), which was in agreement with biometric observations (G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}450-{\'{a}}g-{\'{a}}C-{\'{a}}mG{\c{C}}{\^{o}}2). In contrast, the pasture ecosystem was a strong carbon source in 2008 and 2009 (261-{\'{a}}g-{\'{a}}C-{\'{a}}mG{\c{C}}{\^{o}}2), associated with seasonal drought and overgrazing. In addition, soil carbon isotope data indicated rapid carbon turnover after conversion from C4 pasture to C3 afforestation. Our results clearly show the potential for considerable carbon sequestration of tropical afforestation and highlight the risk of carbon losses from pasture ecosystems in a seasonal tropical climate},

The measured flux data showed that the annual net carbon uptake of the subtropical forest was generally much larger than that for the tropical forest. The mean net ecosystem exchange (NEE) over 6 years was -397±94gCm-2yr-1for the subtropical forest and -166±49gCm-2yr-1for the tropical forest with different seasonal variations. The subtropical forest was a carbon sink for most months in a year, while the tropical forest was a carbon source in wet seasons (positive NEE) and a carbon sink in dry seasons (negative NEE). Both forests were stronger carbon sink in dry years, because of much larger reduction in ER than in wet years. At the seasonal scale, GPP in wet seasons was 37.1{\%} higher than that for dry seasons in the subtropical forest, and was only 12.4{\%} higher in the tropical forest. The amplitude of seasonal GPP variation in the tropical forest was much weaker than in the subtropical forest, but the amplitude of the seasonal variation in ER was much larger than in the subtropical forest. The seasonal variation in NEE was largely driven by the variation in monthly ER of the tropical forest, and by both seasonal variations in monthly GPP and ER of the subtropical forest. At inter-annual scale, annual NEE varied tightly with annual rainfall from year to year. Therefore annual rainfall was suggested a fundamental driver of annual carbon sequestration in the subtropical and tropical forests in southern China. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Accurate measurements of energy fluxes between land and atmosphere are important for understanding and modeling climatic patterns. Several methods are available to measure heat fluxes, and scintillometers are becoming increasingly popular because of their ability to measure sensible (. H) and latent (. LvE) heat fluxes over large spatial scales. The main motivation of this study was to test the use of different methods and technologies to derive surface heat fluxes.Measurements of H and LvE were carried out with an eddy covariance (EC) system, two different makes of optical large aperture scintillometers (LAS) and two microwave scintillometers (MWS) with different frequencies at a pasture site in a semi-arid environment of New South Wales, Australia. We used the EC measurements as a benchmark. Fluxes derived from the EC system and LAS systems agreed (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}{\textgreater}0.94), whereas the MWS systems measured lower H (bias {\~{}}60Wm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) and larger LvE (bias {\~{}}65Wm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}) than EC. When the scintillometers were compared against each other, the two LASs showed good agreement of H (R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}=0.98), while MWS with different frequencies and polarizations led to different results. Combination of LAS and MWS measurements (i.e., two wavelength method) resulted in performance that fell in between those estimated using either LAS or MWS alone when compared with the EC system. The cause for discrepancies between surface heat fluxes derived from the EC system and those from the MWS systems and the two-wavelength method are possibly related to inaccurate assignment of the structure parameter of temperature and humidity. Additionally, measurements from MWSs can be associated with two values of the Bowen ratio, thereby leading to uncertainties in the estimation of the fluxes. While only one solution has been considered in this study, when LvE was approximately less than 200Wm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, the alternate solution may be more accurate. Therefore, for measurements of surface heat fluxes in a semi-arid or dry environment, the optical scintillometer is recommended, whereas further work will be required to improve the estimation of surface heat fluxes from microwave systems.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rewetting of long-term drained fens often results in the formation of eutrophic shallow lakes with an average water depth of less than 1 m. This is accompanied by a fast vegetation shift from cultivated grasses via submerged hydrophytes to helophytes. As a result of rapid plant dying and decomposition, these systems are highly-dynamic wetlands characterised by a high mobilisation of nutrients and elevated emissions of CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}. However, the impact of specific plant species on these phenomena is not clear. Therefore we investigated the CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} production due to the subaqueous decomposition of shoot biomass of five selected plant species which represent different rewetting stages ({\textless}i{\textgreater}Phalaris arundinacea{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Ceratophyllum demersum{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Typha latifolia{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, {\textless}i{\textgreater}Phragmites australis{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Carex riparia{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) during a 154 day mesocosm study. Beside continuous gas flux measurements, we performed bulk chemical analysis of plant tissue, including carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and plant polymer dynamics. Plant specific mass losses after 154 days ranged from 25 ({\textless}i{\textgreater}P. australis{\textless}/i{\textgreater}) to 64{\%} ({\textless}i{\textgreater}C. demersum{\textless}/i{\textgreater}). Substantial differences were found for the CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} production with highest values from decomposing {\textless}i{\textgreater}C. demersum{\textless}/i{\textgreater} (0.4 g CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} kg{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}minus;1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} dry mass day) that were about 70 times higher than CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} production from {\textless}i{\textgreater}C. riparia{\textless}/i{\textgreater}. Thus, we found a strong divergence between mass loss of the litter and methane production during decomposition. If {\textless}i{\textgreater}C. demersum{\textless}/i{\textgreater} as a hydrophyte is included in the statistical analysis solely nutrient contents (nitrogen and phosphorus) explain varying GHG production of the different plant species while lignin and polyphenols demonstrate no significant impact at all. Taking data of annual biomass production as important carbon source for methanogens into account, high CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions can be expected to last several decades as long as inundated and nutrient-rich conditions prevail. Different restoration measures like water level control, biomass extraction and top soil removal are discussed in the context of mitigation of CH{\textless}sub{\textgreater}4{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emissions from rewetted fens.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Assessing the long-term exchange of trace gases and energy between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere is an important priority of the current climate change research. In this regard, it is particularly significant to provide valid data on simultaneous fluxes of carbon, water vapor and pollutants over representative ecosystems. Eddy covariance measurements and model analyses of such combined fluxes over a subalpine coniferous forest in southern Wyoming (USA) are presented. While the exchange of water vapor and ozone are successfully measured by the eddy covariance system, fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) are uncertain. This is established by comparing measured fluxes with simulations produced by a detailed biophysical model (FORFLUX). The bias in CO2flux measurements is partially attributed to below-canopy advection caused by a complex terrain. We emphasize the difficulty of obtaining continuous long-term flux data in mountainous areas by direct measurements. Instrumental records are combined with simulation models as a feasible approach to assess seasonal and annual ecosystem exchange of carbon, water and ozone in alpine environments. The viability of this approach is demonstrated by: (1) showing the ability of the FORFLUX model to predict observed fluxes over a 9-day period in the summer of 1996; and (2) applying the model to estimate seasonal dynamics and annual totals of ozone deposition and carbon, and water vapor exchange at our study site. Estimated fluxes above this subalpine ecosystem in 1996 are: 195 g C m-2year-1net ecosystem production, 277 g C m-2year-1net primary production, 535 mm year-1total evapo-transpiration, 174 mm year-1canopy transpiration, 2.9 g m-2year-1total ozone deposition, and 1.72 g O3m-2year-1plant ozone uptake via leaf stomata. Given the large portion of non-stomatal ozone uptake (i.e. 41{\%} of the total annual flux) predicted for this site, we suggest that future research of pollution-vegetation interactions should relate plant response to actively assimilated ozone by foliage rather than to total deposition. In this regard, we propose the Physiological Ozone Uptake Per Unit of Leaf Area (POUPULA) as a practical index for quantifying vegetation vulnerability to ozone damage. We estimate POUPULA to be 0.614 g O3m-2leaf area year-1at our subalpine site in 1996.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Author(s) 2014. Understanding the response of forest net ecosystem productivity (NEP) to environmental drivers under climate change is highly relevant for predictions of annual forest carbon (C) flux budgets. Modeling annual forest NEP with soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer models (SVATs), however, remains challenging due to unknown delayed responses to weather of the previous year. In this study, we addressed the influence of previous year's weather on the interannual variability of NEP for a subalpine spruce forest in Switzerland. Analysis of long-term (1997-2011) eddy covariance measurements showed that the Norway spruce forest Davos Seehornwald was a consistent sink for atmospheric CO2, sequestering 210 ± 88 g C m-2 yr-1 on average. Previous year's weather strongly affected interannual variability of NEP, increasing the explained variance in linear models to 53{\%} compared to 20{\%} without accounting for previous year's weather. Thus, our results highlight the need to consider previous year's weather in modeling annual C budgets of forests. Furthermore, soil temperature in the current year's spring played a major role controlling annual NEP, mainly by influencing gross primary productivity early in the year, with spring NEP accounting for 56{\%} of annual NEP. Consequently, we expect an increase in net CO2 uptake with future climate warming, as long as no other resources become limiting.},
