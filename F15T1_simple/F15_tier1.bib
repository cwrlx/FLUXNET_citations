abstract = {Carbon (C) uptake rates in many forests are sustained, or decline only briefly, following disturbances that partially defoliate the canopy. The mechanisms supporting such functional resistance to moderate forest disturbance are largely unknown. We used a large scale experiment, in which {\textgreater}6700 Populus (aspen) and Betula (birch) trees were stem-girdled within a 39-ha area, to identify mechanisms sustaining C uptake through partial canopy defoliation. The Forest Accelerated Succession Experiment in northern Michigan, USA, employs a suite of C-cycling measurements within paired treatment and control meteorolog ical flux tower footprints. We found that enhancement of canopy light-use efficiency and maintenance of light absorption maintained net ecosystem production (NEP) and aboveground wood net primary production (NPP) when leaf-area index (LAI) of the treatment forest temporarily declined by nearly half its maximum value. In the year following peak defoliation, redistribution of nitrogen (N) in the treatment forest from senescent early successional aspen and birch to non-girdled later successional species facilitated the recovery of total LAI to pre-disturbance levels. Sustained canopy physiological competency following disturbance coincided with a downward shift in maximum canopy height, indicating that compensatory photosynthetic C uptake by undisturbed, later successional subdominant and subcanopy vegetation supported C-uptake resistance to disturbance. These findings have implications for ecosystem management and modeling, demonstrating that forests may tolerate considerable leaf-area losses without diminishing rates of C uptake. We conclude that the resistance of C uptake to moderate disturbance depends not only on replacement of lost leaf area, but also on rapid compensatory photosynthetic C uptake during defoliation by emerging later successional species.},

abstract = {Old-growth forests are often assumed to exhibit no net carbon assimilation over time periods of several years. This generalization has not been typically supported by the few whole-ecosystem, stand-scale eddy-covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange in old-growth forests. An eddy-flux tower installed in a {\textgreater}300-year-old hemlock-hardwood forest near the Sylvania Wilderness, Ottawa National Forest, MI, USA, observed a small annual carbon sink of CO2of -72 ± 36 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and -147 ± 42 g C m-2year-1in 2003. This carbon sink was much smaller than carbon sinks of -438 ± 49 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and -490 ± 48 g C m-2year-1in 2003 observed by a nearby flux tower in a 70-year-old mature hardwood forest (Willow Creek, WI). The mature forest had vegetation similar to the old-growth site prior to European settlement. Both sites had slightly larger carbon sinks in 2003, which was a drier and cooler year than 2002. However, the difference in sink strength between the two years was smaller than the uncertainty in the results arising from missing and screened data. Both sites also had significant systematic errors due to non-representative fluxes during certain micrometeorological conditions, which required careful screening. The difference in sink strength between the two sites was driven mainly by greater ER at the old-growth site (965 ± 35 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and 883 ± 69 g C m-2year-1in 2003) compared to the mature site (668 ± 21 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and 703 ± 17 g C m-2year-1in 2003). GEP was lower at the old-growth site (1037 ± 47 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and 1030 ± 41 g C m-2year-1in 2003) compared to the mature site (1106 ± 47 g C m-2year-1in 2002 and 1192 ± 51 g C m-2year-1in 2003), especially in 2003. Observations also suggested that growing season ER had greater interannual variability at the old-growth site. These results imply that old-growth forests in the region may be carbon sinks, though these sinks are smaller than mature forests, mostly likely due to greater ER. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The lack of information on the ways seasonal drought modifies the CO2 exchange between Neotropical rainforest ecosystems and the atmosphere and the resulting carbon balance hinders our ability to precisely predict how these ecosystems will respond as global environmental changes force them to face increasingly contrasting conditions in the future. To address this issue, seasonal variations in daily net ecosystem productivity (NEPd) and two main components of this productivity, daily total ecosystem respiration (REd) and daily gross ecosystem productivity (GEPd), were estimated over 2 years at a flux tower site in French Guiana, South America (5 °16′54″N, 52 °54′44″W). We compared seasonal variations between wet and dry periods and between dry periods of contrasting levels of intensity (i.e. mild vs. severe) during equivalent 93-day periods. During the wet periods, the ecosystem was almost in balance with the atmosphere (storage of 9.0 g C m−2). Seasonal dry periods, regardless of their severity, are associated with higher incident radiation and lower REd combined with reduced soil respiration associated with low soil water availability. During the mild dry period, as is normally the case in this region, the amount of carbon stored in the ecosystem was 32.7 g C m−2. Severe drought conditions resulted in even lower REd, whereas the photosynthetic activity was only moderately reduced and no change in canopy structure was observed. Thus, the severe dry period was characterized by greater carbon storage (64.6 g C m−2), emphasizing that environmental conditions, such as during a severe drought, modify the CO2 exchange between Neotropical rainforest ecosystems and the atmosphere and potentially the resulting carbon balance.},

abstract = {Two years of continuous measurements of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) using the eddy covariance technique were made over a Mediterranean alpine shrubland. This ecosystem was found to be a net source of CO2 (+ 52 +/- 7 g C m(-2) and + 48 +/- 7 g C m(-2) for 2007 and 2008) during the two-year study period. To understand the reasons underlying this net release of CO2 into the atmosphere, we analysed the drivers of seasonal variability in NEE over these two years. We observed that the soil water availability - driven by the precipitation pattern - and the photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) are the key factors for understanding both the carbon sequestration potential and the duration of the photosynthetic period during the growing season. Finally, the effects of the self-heating correction to CO2 and H2O fluxes measured with the open-path infrared gas analyser were evaluated. Applying the correction turned the annual CO2 budget in 2007 from a sink (-135 +/- 7 g C m(-2)) to a source (+ 52 +/- 7 g C m(-2)). The magnitude of this change is larger than reported previously and is shown to be due to the low air density and cold temperatures at this high elevation study site.},

abstract = {In order to investigate the annual variation of soil respiration and its components in relation to seasonal changes in soil temperature and soil moisture in a Mediterranean mixed oak forest ecosystem, we set up a series of experimental treatments in May 1999 where litter (no litter), roots (no roots, by trenching) or both were excluded from plots of 4 m(2) . Subsequently, we measured soil respiration, soil temperature and soil moisture in each plot over a year after the forest was coppiced. The treatments did not significantly affect soil temperature or soil moisture measured over 0-10 cm depth.  Soil respiration varied markedly during the year with high rates in spring and autumn and low rates in summer, coinciding with summer drought, and in winter, with the lowest temperatures. Very high respiration rates, however, were observed during the summer immediately after rainfall events. The mean annual rate of soil respiration was 2.9 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) , ranging from 1.35 to 7.03 mumol m(-2) s(-1) .  Soil respiration was highly correlated with temperature during winter and during spring and autumn whenever volumetric soil water content was above 20{\%}. Below this threshold value, there was no correlation between soil respiration and soil temperature, but soil moisture was a good predictor of soil respiration. A simple empirical model that predicted soil respiration during the year, using both soil temperature and soil moisture accounted for more than 91{\%} of the observed annual variation in soil respiration.  All the components of soil respiration followed a similar seasonal trend and were affected by summer drought. The Q (10) value for soil respiration was 2.32, which is in agreement with other studies in forest ecosystems. However, we found a Q (10) value for root respiration of 2.20, which is lower than recent values reported for forest sites. The fact that the seasonal variation in root growth with temperature in Mediterranean ecosystems differs from that in temperate regions may explain this difference. In temperate regions, increases in size of root populations during the growing season, coinciding with high temperatures, may yield higher apparent Q (10) values than in Mediterranean regions where root growth is suppressed by summer drought.  The decomposition of organic matter and belowground litter were the major components of soil respiration, accounting for almost 55{\%} of the total soil respiration flux. This proportion is higher than has been reported for mature boreal and temperate forest and is probably the result of a short-term C loss following recent logging at the site.  The relationship proposed for soil respiration with soil temperature and soil moisture is useful for understanding and predicting potential changes in Mediterranean forest ecosystems in response to forest management and climate change.

abstract = {Land use change and grassland degradation are two of the most critical problems ubiquitously found in arid and semi-arid areas in Northern China. Energy fluxes, including net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), sensible heat flux (H) and soil heat flux (G), were examined over an entire year (December 2005 to November 2006) in different steppe ecosystems - the steppe and cropland in Duolun and the fenced and grazed steppe in Xilinhot - in Inner Mongolia based on direct measurements from four eddy-covariance flux towers. The seasonal changes in Rn, LE, H and G of the four sites were similar, with very low values during the period of snow cover from December to February, followed by a gradual increase in the growing season. The opposite seasonal patterns of the LE and H fraction resulted in significant seasonal changes in Bowen ratio ($\beta$). Human activity in cropland ecosystems not only resulted in a rapidly shift between LE and H, but also triggered a decrease in latent heat fraction because of a shortened growing season of crop plants. The significantly positive relationships between canopy surface conductance (gc) and LE/LEeqof all of the study sites suggested that a lack of precipitation coupled with high VPD conduced remarkable decreases of stomatal conductance. This could impede the latent heat partitioning of available energy (Rn- G) in semi-arid ecosystems, Inner Mongolia. The obvious decrease in the values of gcand the decoupling factor ($\Omega$) in both the cropland and the degraded steppe suggested that land use change could depress latent flux fraction and increase its sensitivity to air and soil drought. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ecosystem respiration, arising from soil decomposition as well as from plant maintenance and growth, has been shown to be the most important component of carbon exchange in most terrestrial ecosystems. The goal of this study was to estimate the growth component of whole-ecosystem respiration in a Mediterranean evergreen oak (Quercus ilex) forest over the course of 3 years. Ecosystem respiration (R-eco) was determined from night-time carbon dioxide flux (F-c) using eddy correlation when friction velocity (u(*)) was greater than 0.35 m s(-1) We postulated that growth respiration could be evaluated as a residual after removing modeled base R-eco from whole-ecosystem R-eco during periods when growth was most likely occurring. We observed that the model deviated from the night-time F-c-based R-eco during the period from early February to early July with the largest discrepancies occurring at the end of May, coinciding with budburst when active aboveground growth and radial growth increment are greatest. The highest growth respiration rates were observed in 2001 with daily fluxes reaching up to 4 g C m(-2). The cumulative growth respiration for the entire growth period gave total carbon losses of 170, 208, and 142 g C m(-2) for 1999, 2001, and 2002, respectively. Biochemical analysis of soluble carbohydrates, starch, cellulose, hemicellulose, proteins, lignin, and lipids for leaves and stems allowed calculation of the total construction costs of the different growth components, which yielded values of 154, 200, and 150 g C for 3 years, respectively, corresponding well to estimated growth respiration. Estimates of both leaf and stem growth showed very large interannual variation, although average growth respiration coefficients and average yield of growth processes were fairly constant over the 3 years and close to literature values. The time course of the growth respiration may be explained by the growth pattern of leaves and stems and by cambial activity. This approach has potential applications for interpreting the effects of climate variation, disturbances, and management practices on growth and ecosystem respiration.},

abstract = {We studied a semi-natural forest in Northern Italy that was set aside more than 50 years ago, in order to better understand the soil carbon cycle and in particular the partitioning of soil respiration between autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. Here we report on soil organic carbon, root density, and estimates of annual fluxes of soil CO2as measured with a mobile chamber system at 16 permanent collars about monthly during the course of a year. We partitioned between autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration by the indirect regression method, which enabled us to obtain the seasonal pattern of single components. The soil pool of organic carbon, with 15.8 (±4.5)kgm-2, was very high over the entire depth of 45cm. The annual respiration rates ranged from 0.6 to 6.9$\mu$molCO2m-2s-1with an average value of 3.4 (±2.3)$\mu$molCO2m-2s-1, and a cumulative flux of 1.1kgCm-2yr-1. The heterotrophic component accounted for 66{\%} of annual CO2efflux. Soil temperature largely controlled the heterotrophic respiration (R2=0.93), while the autotrophic component followed irradiation, pointing to the role of photosynthesis in modulating the annual course of soil respiration. Most studies on soil respiration partitioning indicate autotrophic root respiration as a first control of the spatial variability of the overall respiration, which originates mainly from the uppermost soil layers. Instead, in our forest the spatial variability of soil respiration was mainly linked to soil carbon, and deeper layers seemed to provide a significant contribution to soil respiration, a feature that may be typical for an undisturbed, naturally maturing ecosystem with well developed pedobiological processes and high carbon stocks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier GmbH.},

Fluxes were measured using micrometeorological methods and neural network analysis was used to fill gaps in the hourly flux time series. Productivity at Virginia Park is controlled by rainfall amount and timing during the wet season since this determines the leaf area index (Lai) of the C4grass understorey which varies greatly compared to Laiof the trees. The savanna lost 99 g C m-2over the period July 2001-March 2004 due to the failure of the 2002-2003 wet season when rainfall was in the lowest 20th percentile. Net uptake of carbon at Tumbarumba was 2510 g C m-2from February 2001 to March 2004, with annual productivity ranging from 1060 g C m-2year-1in a normal year to 360 g C m-2year-1during the 2002-2003 drought which affected all of eastern Australia. Annual rainfall at the savanna was matched by annual evapotranspiration, indicating there was no surface runoff or deep drainage during our study. Trees at both sites were able to extract water deep within the soil profile to maintain annual transpiration above rainfall during the drought of 2002-2003. Measurements of Laiand gross primary production (PG) at the two sites were compared to estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data products. The MOD15 algorithm overestimated Laiby a factor of two at Tumbarumba but gave reasonable magnitudes and seasonal variation for the savanna. At Tumbarumba, MOD17 gave excellent estimates of the annual amplitude in PGbut was less satisfactory in predicting the phase of the variations. MOD17 overestimated PGat Virginia Park during the dry season and the low-rainfall summer of 2002-2003 but gave satisfactory results during the other two wet seasons. Most of the variance in PGat both sites was explained by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation. Significantly improved predictions were obtained for the savanna by modifying the MOD17 algorithm to account for rainfall and potential evaporation in the antecedent 3 months, a surrogate for soil water availability. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) was mea-sured with eddy covariance method for two adjacent forests located at the southern boundary of European taiga in Russia in 1999–2004. The two spruce forests shared similar vege-tation composition but differed in soil conditions. The wet spruce forest (WSF) possessed a thick peat layer (60 cm) with a high water table seasonally close to or above the soil surface. The dry spruce forest (DSF) had a relatively thin organic layer (5 cm) with a deep water table ({\textgreater}60 cm). The measured multi-year average NEE fluxes (2000 and – 1440 kg C ha −1 yr −1 for WSF and DSF, respectively) indi-cated that WSF was a source while DSF a sink of atmo-spheric carbon dioxide (CO 2) during the experimental years. A process-based model, Forest-DNDC, was employed in the study to interpret the observations. The modeled multi-year average NEE fluxes were 1800 and –2200 kg C ha −1 yr −1 for WSF and DSF, respectively, which were comparable with observations. The modeled data also showed high soil het-erotrophic respiration rates at WSF that suggested that the water table fluctuation at WSF could have played a key role in determining the negative carbon balance in the wetland ecosystem. A sensitivity test was conducted by running Forest-DNDC with varied water table scenarios for WSF. The results indicated that the NEE fluxes from WSF were highly sensitive to the water table depth. When the water table was high, the WSF ecosystem maintained as a sink of atmospheric CO 2 ; while along with the drop of the water table the length of the flooded period reduced and more or-ganic matter in the soil profile suffered from rapid decompo-sition that gradually converted the ecosystem into a source of atmospheric CO 2 . The general effect of water table vari-ation on wetland carbon balance observed from this model-Correspondence to: C.

abstract = {Eddy covariance measurements of CO2fluxes were conducted in 2004 at the agricultural site of Lonz{\'{e}}e, Belgium, over a sugar beet crop. Additional measurements of biomass net primary production and leaf area index (LAI) were carried out. The response of the fluxes to climatic and non-climatic variables was analysed. Nighttime fluxes were dependent on turbulence, temperature and high soil water content. The u*correction was determined using a statistically based algorithm. The lower u*threshold was 0.1 m s-1. Daytime fluxes during maximum canopy development depended mainly on incident radiation and its repartition between direct and diffuse components. A limited response to saturation deficit and soil water content was also observed. The evolution of assimilation and respiration throughout the growing season was studied. Maximum assimilation fluxes were observed in July when canopy had not fully developed and these then decreased from the end of July to the harvest, due not only to a reduction in radiation but also to a reduction in canopy assimilation capacity. Normalised respiration evolution presented two peaks during the year: the first in July, when the assimilation was at its greatest, and the second after the harvest, during the crop residues decomposition. The annual sequestration, estimated by half-hourly flux summing and measurement gap filling, was -0.61 ± 0.11 kg C m-2and the impact of the u*correction and of the residues decomposition was estimated to be 5.3 and 3.5{\%}, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Climate, vegetation cover, and management create finescale heterogeneity in unirrigated agricultural regions, with important but not well-quantified consequences for spatial and temporal variations in surface CO2, water, and heat fluxes. Eddy covariance fluxes were measured in seven agricultural fields-comprising winter wheat, pasture, and sorghum - in the U.S. Southern Great Plains (SGP) during the 2001 - 03 growing seasons. Land cover was the dominant source of variation in surface fluxes, with 50{\%}-100{\%} differences between fields planted in winter - spring versus fields planted in summer. Interannual variation was driven mainly by precipitation, which varied more than twofold between years. Peak aboveground biomass and growing season net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 increased in rough proportion to precipitation. Based on a partitioning of gross fluxes with a regression model, ecosystem respiration increased linearly with gross primary production, but with an offset that increased near the time of seed production. Because the regression model was designed for well-watered periods, it successfully retrieved NEE and ecosystem parameters during the peak growing season and identified periods of moisture limitation during the summer. In summary, the effects of crop type, land management, and water limitation on carbon, water, and energy fluxes were large. Capturing the controlling factors in landscape-scale models will be necessary to estimate the ecological feedbacks to climate and other environmental impacts associated with changing human needs for agricultural production of food, fiber, and energy.},

abstract = {Changes in the hydrological cycle, as predicted and currently observed, are expected to significantly impact the water and carbon balance of water-limited forest ecosystems. However, differences in the water-sensitivity of component processes make carbon balance predictions challenging. To examine responses of ecosystem components to water limitations, we conducted a study of tree, soil and ecosystem-level processes in a young ponderosa pine stand under natural summer drought (control) and increased soil water conditions (watered). Weekly-averaged tree transpiration (Ttree), gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GPP) and soil CO2efflux (Rstree; nearby trees) were related with soil water content (SWC; polynomial form: TtreeR2=0.98 and RstreeR2=0.91, logarithmic form: GPP R2=0.86) and declined rapidly when relative extractable soil water (REW) was {\textless}50{\%}. The sensitivity of daily variations in canopy conductance (Gs) to vapor pressure deficit was affected by SWC (R2=0.97; logarithmic function), decreasing at REW {\textless}50{\%}. Watering maintained REW at about 70{\%} in July and August but positively affected tree carbon and water dynamics only at the end of summer when fluxes in the control treatment were strongly water-limited. A tight coupling of above- and belowground fluxes became apparent. In the control treatment, root-rhizosphere respiration (Rr) decreased along with GPP and Ttree(R2=0.58) as drought progressed, while watering maintained Rr, Ttreeand Gsat a significantly higher level than those of the unwatered trees in late summer. In contrast, microbial respiration responded instantaneously and strongly to the watering compared to the control treatment. The net effect was that increased soil water availability during the typical dry growing season has a negative effect on the short-term seasonal ecosystem C balance due to a larger increase in decomposition than photosynthesis. However, longer-term effects remain uncertain. In summary, our study highlights that understanding the dissimilar response of tree dynamics and soil decomposition to water availability is a key component in predicting future C sequestration in water-limited forest ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide exchange was quantified in maize-soybean agroecosystems employing year-round tower eddy covariance flux systems and measurements of soil C stocks, CO2fluxes from the soil surface, plant biomass, and litter decomposition. Measurements were made in three cropping systems: (a) irrigated continuous maize, (b) irrigated maize-soybean rotation, and (c) rainfed maize-soybean rotation during 2001-2004. Because of a variable cropping history, all three sites were uniformly tilled by disking prior to initiation of the study. Since then, all sites are under no-till, and crop and soil management follow best management practices prescribed for production-scale systems. Cumulative daily gain of C by the crops (from planting to physiological maturity), determined from the measured eddy covariance CO2fluxes and estimated heterotrophic respiration, compared well with the measured total above and belowground biomass. Two contrasting features of maize and soybean CO2exchange are notable. The value of integrated GPP (gross primary productivity) for both irrigated and rainfed maize over the growing season was substantially larger (ca. 2:1 ratio) than that for soybean. Also, soybean lost a larger portion (0.80-0.85) of GPP as ecosystem respiration (due, in part, to the large amount of maize residue from the previous year), as compared to maize (0.55-0.65). Therefore, the seasonally integrated NEP (net ecosystem production) in maize was larger by a 4:1 ratio (approximately), as compared to soybean. Enhanced soil moisture conditions in the irrigated maize and soybean fields caused an increase in ecosystem respiration, thus eliminating any advantage of increased GPP and giving about the same values for the growing season NEP as the rainfed fields. On an annual basis, the NEP of irrigated continuous maize was 517, 424, and 381 g C m-2year-1, respectively, during the 3 years of our study. In rainfed maize the annual NEP was 510 and 397 g C m-2year-1in years 1 and 3, respectively. The annual NEP in the irrigated and rainfed soybean fields were in the range of -18 to -48 g C m-2. Accounting for the grain C removed during harvest and the CO2released from irrigation water, our tower eddy covariance flux data over the first 3 years suggest that, at this time: (a) the rainfed maize-soybean rotation system is C neutral, (b) the irrigated continuous maize is nearly C neutral or a slight source of C, and (c) the irrigated maize-soybean rotation is a moderate source of C. Direct measurement of soil C stocks could not detect a statistically significant change in soil organic carbon during the first 3 years of no-till farming in these three cropping systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fire and harvesting are major forest renewal processes in the Canadian boreal forest. The eddy covariance method was used to compare ecosystem fluxes of carbon dioxide between harvested and burned boreal forest sites in Saskatchewan, Canada. The harvest chronosequence had sites harvested in 2002 (HJP02), 1994 (HJP94) and 1975 (HJP75), whereas the fire chronosequence sites were burned in 1998 (F98), 1989 (F89), 1977 (F77) and 1929 (OJP). All sites were dominated by jack pine prior to the disturbance. During 2004 and 2005, net ecosystem production showed an average carbon gain (g C m-2year-1) at F89 = 84, HJP75 = 80, HJP94 = 14 and OJP = 20. The other sites lost carbon (g C m-2year-1) at HJP02 = -139, F98 = -20, and F77 = -58. Gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (Re) and evapotranspiration tended to be greater at the burned sites than the harvested sites. The F89 and F77 sites had the strongest response of GEP to photosynthetically active radiation, and the strongest response of Reto soil temperature at the 2-cm depth. HJP02 had the weakest responses, followed by HJP94. This apparent greater ecosystem activity at the burned sites is likely caused by local differences in soil moisture and nutrients, differences in vegetation development, and differences in the decomposition of coarse woody debris. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Although mature black spruce forests are a dominant cover type in the boreal forest of North America, it is not clear how their carbon (C) budgets vary across the continent. The installation of an eddy covariance flux tower on an Old Black Spruce (OBS) site in eastern Canada (EOBS, Qu�bec) provided a first opportunity to compare and contrast its annual (2004) and seasonal C exchange with two other pre-existing OBS flux sites from different climatic regions located in Saskatchewan [Southern OBS (SOBS)] and Manitoba [Northern OBS (NOBS)]. Although there was a relatively uniform seasonal pattern of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) among sites, EOBS had a lower total annual NEP than the other two sites. This was primarily because warmer soil under a thicker snowpack at EOBS appeared to increase winter C losses and low light suppressed both NEP and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) in June. Across sites, greater total annual GEP and ecosystem respiration (R) were associated with greater mean annual air temperatures and an earlier beginning of the growing season. Also, GEP at all three sites showed a stronger relationship with air temperature in spring and early summer compared with later in the growing season, highlighting the importance of springtime conditions to the C budget of these boreal ecosystems. The three sites had different parameter estimates describing the responses of R and GEP at the half hour time scale to near surface temperature and light, respectively. On the other hand, the responses of both R and GEP to temperature at the monthly scale did not differ among sites. These results suggest that a general parameterization could be sufficient at coarse time resolutions to model the response of C exchange to environmental factors of mature black spruce forests from different climatic regions},

abstract = {Savannas comprise a large proportion of the terrestrial land surface and are highly varied in their composition, structure and function. These characteristics alter land-atmosphere exchanges of heat, water, carbon dioxide and other trace gases, which feed back to the climate at multiple scales. Australian savannas provide significant ecosystem services and further systematic scientific study is needed to sustainably manage these ecosystems. We undertook an interdisciplinary research effort to understand the patterns and processes of carbon, water and energy cycles across northern Australian landscapes across scales from point to region. We quantified the land surface-atmosphere exchanges across the vast region of Australian savannas using a hierarchical, integrated measurement and modelling approach to determine regional greenhouse gas and water budgets. The research team comprised groups from seven institutions and four countries. The research effort comprised of a multi- year measurement and modelling endeavour and culminated in an intensive field program held in September 2008 (late dry season). The program aimed to improve our knowledge of the spatial and temporal variability of land-atmosphere exchanges and the processes driving them as well as our ability to remotely sense them and simulate them using land surface models, which are crucial components of Global Climate Models. We attempted to robustly integrate small scale processes, such as leaf photosynthesis to larger scales applicable to modelling and remote sensing for the savanna region. In this paper we provide the scientific background and our overall approach to the program with reference to the papers in this "Savanna Patterns of Energy and Carbon Integrated Across the Landscape" (SPECIAL) issue. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The carbon exchange of managed temperate grassland, previously converted from arable rotation, was quantified for two levels of management intensities over a period of 3 years. The original field on the Swiss Central Plateau had been separated into two plots of equal size, one plot was subjected to intensive management with nitrogen inputs of 200 kg ha-1 year-1 and frequent cutting, and the other to extensive management with no fertilization and less frequent cutting. For both plots, net CO2 exchange (NEE) was monitored by the eddy covariance technique, and the flux data were submitted to extensive quality control and gap filling procedures. Cumulative NEE was combined with values for carbon export through biomass harvests and carbon import through application of liquid manure (intensive field only) to yield the annual net carbon balance of the grassland ecosystems. The intensive management was associated with an average net carbon sequestration of 147 (??130) g C m-2 year-1, whereas the extensive management caused a non-significant net carbon loss of 57 (+130/-110) g C m-2 year-1. Despite the large uncertainty ranges for the two individual systems, the special design of the paired experiment led to a reduced error of the differential effect, because very similar systematic errors for both parallel fields could be assumed. The mean difference in the carbon budget over the 3-year study period was determined to be significant with a value of 204 (??110) g C m-2 year-1. The difference occurred in spite of similar aboveground productivities and root biomass. Additional measurements of soil respiration under standardized laboratory conditions indicated higher rates of soil organic carbon loss through mineralization under the extensive management. These data suggest that conversion of arable land to managed grassland has a positive effect on the carbon balance during the initial 3 years, but only if the system receives extra nitrogen inputs to avoid carbon losses through increased mineralization of soil organic matter. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Unmanaged forests at a late stage of successional development are considered to be insignificant as carbon sinks, since in theory, assimilation is thought to be balanced by respiration. However, little experimental evidence for this hypothesis exists so far for forests at the ecosystem level. Therefore, we performed continuous eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide over an unmanaged beech forest in the Hainich National Park in Central Germany as part of the EU project CARBOEUROFLUX. This forest shows typical characteristics of an 'advanced' forest with large dead wood pools, a diverse stand structure and a wide tree age class distribution, up to 250 years. This forest was a large carbon sink over 2 years, with 494 g C m-2per year in 2000 and 490 g C m-2per year in 2001. Daytime summer fluxes were strongly controlled by photosynthetic photon flux density (R2= 0.7-0.9), with minor effects of the ratio of diffuse to total downward radiation or the vapor pressure deficit. Nighttime CO2fluxes were mainly controlled by soil temperature (R2= 0.8) and soil moisture. In addition, high nighttime CO2fluxes (4-6 $\mu$mol m-2s-1) were found directly before and during bud break in spring as well as just after leaf fall of both years (2000 and 2001), reflecting stand physiology corresponding to phenological changes, independent of soil temperature. Additional wind profile measurements at five heights within the canopy revealed a decoupling of above and below canopy air flow under conditions of low friction velocity (u* {\textless} 0.4 m s-1), probably indicating down slope drainage. In conclusion, unmanaged forests at a comparatively late stage of successional development can still act as significant carbon sinks with large implications for forest management practice and negotiations about biological sinks within the Kyoto Protocol. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Tower CO2 flux measurements from 20 European grasslands in the EUROGRASSFLUX data set covering a wide range of environmental and management conditions were analyzed with respect to their ecophysiological characteristics and CO2 exchange (gross primary production, Pg, and ecosystem respiration, Re) using light-response function analysis. Photosynthetically active radiation (Q) and top-soil temperature (Ts) were identified as key factors controlling CO2 exchange between grasslands and the atmosphere at the 30-min scale. A nonrectangular hyperbolic light-response model P(Q) and modified nonrectangular hyperbolic light-temperature-response model P(Q, Ts) proved to be flexible tools for modeling CO2 exchange in the light. At night, it was not possible to establish robust instantaneous relationships between CO2 evolution rate rn and environmental drivers, though under certain conditions, a significant relationship rn = r0 ekT Ts was found using observation windows 7-14 days wide. Principal light-response parameters-apparent quantum yield, saturated gross photosynthesis, daytime ecosystem respiration, and gross ecological light-use efficiency, ?? = Pg/Q, display patterns of seasonal dynamics which can be formalized and used for modeling. Maximums of these parameters were found in intensively managed grasslands of Atlantic climate. Extensively used semi-natural grasslands of southern and central Europe have much lower production, respiration, and light-use efficiency, while temperate and mountain grasslands of central Europe ranged between these two extremes. Parameters from light-temperature-response analysis of tower data are in agreement with values obtained using closed chambers and free-air CO2 enrichment. Correlations between light-response and productivity parameters provides the possibility to use the easier to measure parameters to estimate the parameters that are more difficult to measure. Gross primary production (Pg) of European grasslands ranges from 1700 g CO2 m-2 year-1 in dry semi-natural pastures to 6900 g CO2 m-2 year-1 in intensively managed Atlantic grasslands. Ecosystem respiration (Re) is in the range 1800 {\textless} Re {\textless} 6000 g CO2 m-2 year-1. Annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) varies from significant net uptake ({\textgreater}2400 g CO2 m-2 year-1) to significant release ({\textless}-600 g CO2 m-2 year-1), though in 15 out of 19 cases grasslands performed as net CO2 sinks. The carbon source was associated with organic rich soils, grazing, and heat stress. Comparison of Pg, Re, and NEE for tower sites with the same characteristics from previously published papers obtained with other methods did not reveal significant discrepancies. Preliminary results indicate relationships of grassland Pg and Re to macroclimatic factors (precipitation and temperature), but these relationships cannot be reduced to simple monofactorial models. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Croplands mainly act as net sources of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), as well as nitrogen oxide (NO), a precursor of troposheric ozone. We determined the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) balance of a four-year crop rotation, including maize, wheat, barley and mustard, to provide a base for exploring mitigation options of net emissions. The crop rotation had a positive net ecosystem production (NEP) of 4.4 +/- 0.7 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1) but represented a net source of carbon with a net biome production (NBP) of -1.3 +/- 1.1 Mg C ha(-1) y(-1). The nitrogen balance of the rotation was correlated with the carbon balance and resulted in net loss (-24 +/- 28 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). The main nitrogen losses were nitrate leaching (-11.7 +/- 1.0 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) and ammonia volatilization (-9 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)). Dry and wet depositions were 6.7 +/- 3.0 and 5.9 +/- 0.1 kg N ha(-1) y(-1), respectively. Fluxes of nitrous (N2O) and nitric (NO) oxides did not contribute significantly to the N budget (N2O: -1.8 +/- 0.04; NO: -0.7 +/- 0.04 kg N ha(-1) y(-1)) but N2O fluxes equaled 16{\%} of the total greenhouse gas balance. The link between the carbon and nitrogen balances are discussed. Longer term experiments would be necessary to capture the trends in the carbon and nitrogen budgets within the variability of agricultural ecosystems.},

abstract = {Steppe ecosystems represent an interesting case in which the assessment of carbon balance may be performed through a cross validation of the eddy covariance measurements against ecological inventory estimates of carbon exchanges (Ehman, 2002; Curtis, 2002). Indeed, the widespread presence of ideal conditions for the applicability of the eddy covariance technique, as vast and homogeneous grass vegetation cover over flat terrains (Baldocchi, 2003), make steppes a suitable ground to ensure a constrain to flux estimates with independent methodological approaches. We report about the analysis of the carbon cycle of a true steppe ecosystem in southern Siberia during the growing season of 2004 in the framework of the TCOS-Siberia project activities performed by continuous monitoring of CO2 fluxes at ecosystem scale by the eddy covariance method, fortnightly samplings of phytomass, and ingrowth cores extractions for NPP assessment, and weekly measurements of heterotrophic component of soil CO2 effluxes obtained by an experiment of root exclusion. The carbon balance of the monitored natural steppe was, according to micrometeorological measurements, a sink of carbon of 151.730.1 gC m-2, cumulated during the growing season from May to September. This result was in agreement with the independent estimate through ecological inventory which yielded a sink of 150.1 gC m-2 although this method was characterized by a large uncertainty (130{\%}) considering the 95{\%} confidence interval of the estimate. Uncertainties in belowground process estimates account for a large part of the error. Thus, in particular efforts to better quantify the dynamics of root biomass (growth and turnover) have to be undertaken in order to reduce the uncertainties in the assessment of NPP. This assessment should be preferably based on the application of multiple methods, each one characterized by its own merits and flaws.},

abstract = {The Arctic is experiencing disproportionate warming relative to the global average, and the Arctic ecosystems are as a result undergoing considerable changes. Continued monitoring of ecosystem productivity and phenology across temporal and spatial scales is a central part of assessing the magnitude of these changes. This study investigates the ability to use automatic digital camera images (DCIs) as proxy data for gross primary production (GPP) in a complex low Arctic wetland site. Vegetation greenness computed from DCIs was found to correlate significantly (R2=0.62, p{\textless}0.001) with a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product derived from the WorldView-2 satellite. An object-based classification based on a bi-temporal image composite was used to classify the study area into heath, copse, fen, and bedrock. Temporal evolution of vegetation greenness was evaluated and modeled with double sigmoid functions for each plant community. GPP at light saturation modeled from eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements were found to correlate significantly with vegetation greenness for all plant communities in the studied year (i.e., 2010), and the highest correlation was found between modeled fen greenness and GPP (R2=0.85, p{\textless}0.001). Finally, greenness computed within modeled EC footprints were used to evaluate the influence of individual plant communities on the flux measurements. The study concludes that digital cameras may be used as a cost-effective proxy for potential GPP in remote Arctic regions. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

abstract = {Ecosystem flux measurements using the eddy covariance (EC) technique were undertaken in 4 subsequent years during summer for a total of 562 days in an arctic wet tundra ecosystem, located near Cherskii, Far-Eastern Federal District, Russia. Methane (CH4) emissions were measured using permanent chambers. The experimental field is characterized by late thawing of permafrost soils in June and periodic spring floods. A stagnant water table below the grass canopy is fed by melting of the active layer of permafrost and by flood water. Following 3 years of EC measurements, the site was drained by building a 3 m wide drainage channel surrounding the EC tower to examine possible future effects of global change on the tundra tussock ecosystem. Cumulative summertime net carbon fluxes before experimental alteration were estimated to be about + 15 g C m(-2) (i.e. an ecosystem C loss) and + 8 g C m(-2) after draining the study site. When taking CH4 as another important greenhouse gas into account and considering the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 vs. CO2, the ecosystem had a positive GWP during all summers. However CH4 emissions after drainage decreased significantly and therefore the carbon related greenhouse gas flux was much smaller than beforehand (475 253 g C-CO2-e m(-2) before drainage in 2003 vs. 23 26 g C-CO2-e m(-2) after drainage in 2005).

We used MODIS imagery to establish that the tower sites were representative of the patterns of secondary succession in the region, and Landsat images to show that the individual stands have changed over the last 22 years in ways that match the spatially derived trends. The eddy covariance towers were well matched, with similar equipment and programs, which maximized site-to-site precision and allowed us to operate the network in an efficient manner. The six oldest sites were fully operational for ∼90{\%} of the growing season and ∼70{\%} of the dormant season from 2001 or 2002 to 2004, with most of the missing data caused by low battery charge or bad signals from the sonic anemometers. The rates of midday growing-season CO2 uptake recovered to preburn levels within 4 years of fire. The seasonality of land–atmosphere exchange and growing-season length changed markedly with stand age. The foliage in the younger stands (1989, 1998, and 2003 burns) was almost entirely deciduous, which resulted in comparatively short growing seasons that lasted ∼65 days. In contrast, the older stands (1850, 1930, 1964, and 1981) were mostly evergreen, which resulted in comparatively long growing seasons that lasted ∼130 days. The eddy covariance mesonet approach we describe could be used within the context of other ecological experimental designs such as controlled manipulations and gradient comparisons.},

Uptake rates increased systematically, nearly doubling over the period despite forest age of 75–110 years; there were parallel increases in midsummer photosynthetic capacity at high light level (21.5?31.5 mmole m?2s?1), woody biomass (101?115 Mg-C ha?1 from 1993?2005, mostly due to growth of one species, red oak), and peak leaf area index (4.5?5.5 from 1998–2005). The long-term trends were interrupted in 1998 by sharp declines in photosynthetic capacity, net ecosystem exchange (NEE) ofCO2, and other parameters, with recovery over the next 3 years. The observations were compared to empirical functions giving the mean responses to temperature and light, and to a terrestrial ecosystem model (IBIS2). Variations in gross ecosystem exchange of CO2 (GEE) and NEE on hourly to monthly timescales were represented well as prompt responses to the environment, but interannual variations and long-term trends were not. IBIS2 simulated mean annual NEE, but greatly overpredicted the amplitude of the seasonal cycle and did not predict the decadal trend.

abstract = {Savannas and open grasslands often co-exist in semi-arid regions. Questions that remain unanswered and are of interest to biometeorologists include: how do these contrasting landscapes affect the exchanges of energy on seasonal and annual time scales; and, do biophysical constraints imposed by water supply and water demand affect whether the land is occupied by open grasslands or savanna? To address these questions, and others, we examine how a number of abiotic, biotic and edaphic factors modulate water and energy flux densities over an oak-grass savanna and an annual grassland that coexist in the same climate but on soils with different hydraulic properties. The net radiation balance was greater over the oak woodland than the grassland, despite the fact that both canopies received similar sums of incoming short and long wave radiation. The lower albedo and lower radiative surface temperature of the transpiring woodland caused it to intercept and retain more long and shortwave energy over the course of the year, and particularly during the summer dry period. The partitioning of available energy into sensible and latent heat exchanged over the two canopies differed markedly. The annual sum of sensible heat exchange over the woodland was 40{\%} greater than that over the grassland (2.05GJm -2 per year versus 1.46GJm-2 per year). With regards to evaporation, the oak woodland evaporated about 380mm of water per year and the grassland evaporated about 300mm per year. Differences in available energy, canopy roughness, the timing of physiological functioning, water holding capacity of the soil and rooting depth of the vegetation explained the observed differences in sensible and latent heat exchange of the contrasting vegetation surfaces. The response of canopy evaporation to diminishing soil moisture was quantified by comparing normalized evaporation rates (in terms of equilibrium evaporation) with soil water potential and volumetric water content measurements. When soil moisture was ample normalized values of latent heat flux density were greater for the grassland (1.1-1.2) than for the oak savanna (0.7-0.8) and independent of moisture content. Normalized rates of evaporation over the grassland declined as volumetric water content dropped below 0.15m 3m-3, which corresponded with a soil water potential of -1.5MPa. The grassland senesced and quit transpiring when the volumetric water content of the soil dropped below -2.0MPa. The oak trees, on the other hand, were able to transpire, albeit at low rates, under very dry soil conditions (soil water potentials below -4.0MPa). The trees were able to endure such low water potentials and maintain basal levels of metabolism because ecological forcings kept the tree density and leaf area index of the woodland low, physiological factors forced the stomata to close progressively and the trees were able to tap deeper water sources (below 0.6m) than the grasses. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {To understand the dynamics of ecosystem carbon cycling, CO2fluxes were measured over and under an oak-grass savanna and over a proximate grassland in California. The measurements were made from 2000 to 2006 using the eddy covariance technique. Annual net carbon exchange (NEE) ranged from -155 to -56 gC m-2year-1and from -88 to 141 gC m-2year-1at the savanna and nearby grassland, respectively. Inter-annual variability in NEE was significantly related to length of growing season for the savanna, grassland, and tree canopy. We partitioned the NEE into two separate terms-primary productivity (GPP) and respiration (ecosystem respiration, Reco)-and found that the GPP and Recoof the savanna and grassland depended primarily on the amount of seasonal precipitation that occurred while grass and tree canopies were simultaneously active rather than depending on annual precipitation. We also found that NEE was greatly constrained by both Recoand GPP and Recowas significantly constrained by GPP. Recoincreased by 79 gC m-2year-1with each 100 gC m-2year-1increase in GPP. In addition, measuring CO2exchange separately in the overstory and understory of the savanna over multiple years enabled us to partition Recointo heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration terms in a new and direct way. The sensitivity of Recoto GPP (dReco/dGPP) and the baseline of respiration terms both provide useful tools for understanding the dynamics of ecosystem CO2uptake under current conditions of climate and ecosystem succession stage. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract: Afforestation has been proposed as an effective tool for protecting primary and/or secondary forests and for mitigating atmospheric CO2. However, the dynamics of primary productivity differs between plantations and natural forests. The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential for carbon storage of a commercial pine plantation by determining its carbon balance. Measurements started when trees were aged 6 and ended when they were older than 8 years. We measured CO2 and water vapor concentrations using the Eddy covariance method. Gross primary productivity in 2010 and 2011 was 4290 ± 473 g C m-2 and 4015 ± 485 g C m-2, respectively. Ecosystem respiration ranged between 7 and 20 g C m-2 d-1, reaching peaks in all Februaries. Of the 30 months monitored, the plantation acted as carbon source for 21 months and as carbon sink for 6 months, while values close to neutrality were obtained during 3 months. The positive balance representing CO2 loss by the system was most likely due to the cut branches left on the ground following pruning activities. The plantation was subjected to pruning in January and September 2008 and to sanitary pruning in October 2010. In all cases, cut branches were not removed but remained on the ground. Residue management seems to have a very important impact on carbon balance.},

abstract = {After a wildfire, the management of burnt wood may determine microclimatic conditions and microbiological activity with the potential to affect soil respiration. To experimentally analyze the effect on soil respiration, we manipulated a recently burned pine forest in a Mediterranean mountain (Sierra Nevada National and Natural Park, SE Spain). Three representative treatments of post-fire burnt wood management were established at two elevations: (1) "salvage logging" (SL), where all trees were cut, trunks removed, and branches chipped; (2) "non-intervention" (NI), leaving all burnt trees standing; and (3) "cut plus lopping" (CL), a treatment where burnt trees were felled, with the main branches lopped off, but left in situ partially covering the ground surface. Seasonal measurements were carried out over the course of two years. In addition, we performed continuous diurnal campaigns and an irrigation experiment to ascertain the roles of soil temperature and moisture in determining CO2 fluxes across treatments. Soil CO2 fluxes were highest in CL (average of 3.34??0.19??molm-2s-1) and the lowest in SL (2.21??0.11??molm-2s-1). Across seasons, basal values were registered during summer (average of 1.46??0.04??molm-2s-1), but increased during the humid seasons (up to 10.07??1.08??molm-2s-1 in spring in CL). Seasonal and treatment patterns were consistent at the two elevations (1477 and 2317m a.s.l.), although respiration was half as high at the higher altitude.Respiration was mainly controlled by soil moisture. Watering during the summer drought boosted CO2 effluxes (up to 37??6??molm-2s-1 just after water addition), which then decreased to basal values as the soil dried. About 64{\%} of CO2 emissions during the first 24h could be attributed to the degasification of soil pores, with the rest likely related to biological processes. The patterns of CO2 effluxes under experimental watering were similar to the seasonal tendencies, with the highest pulse in CL. Temperature, however, had a weak effect on soil respiration, with Q10 values of ca. 1 across seasons and soil moisture conditions. These results represent a first step towards illustrating the effects of post-fire burnt wood management on soil respiration, and eventually carbon sequestration. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {To assess the variation of soil respiration at different forest stages we measured it in a coppiced oak (Quercus cerris L.) chronosequence in central Italy during two campaigns, spanning 2 successive years, in four stands at different stages of the rotation: 1 year (S1), 5 years (S5), 10 years (S10) and 17 years (S17) after coppicing. The contribution of the different components of soil respiration flux (aboveground litter, belowground decomposition soil organic matter and root respiration) was estimated by a paired comparison of manipulative experiments between the recently coppiced stand (S1) and mature stand (S17). Ninety percent of soil respiration values were between 1.7 and 7.8 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), with an overall mean (+/- SD) of 4.0 +/- 2.7 mu mol m(-2) s(-1). Spatial variation of soil respiration was high (CV=44.9{\%}), with a mean range (i.e. patch size) of 4.8 +/- 2.7 m, as estimated from a semivariance analysis. In the absence of limitation by soil moisture, soil respiration was related to soil temperature with the exponential Q(10) model (average Q(10)=2.25). During summer, soil moisture constrained soil respiration and masked its dependence on soil temperature. Soil respiration declined over the years after coppicing. Assuming a linear decline with stand age, we estimated a reduction of 24{\%} over a 20-year-rotation cycle. The response of soil respiration to temperature also changed with age of the stands: the Q(10) was estimated to decrease from 2.90 in S1 to 2.42 in S17, suggesting that different components or processes may be involved at different developmental stages. The contribution of heterotrophic respiration to total soil respiration flux was relatively larger in the young S1 stand than in the mature S17 stand.},

abstract = {Eddy co-variance measurements of water vapour and CO2fluxes were performed for 15 months at the Vielsalm experimental site (Belgian Ardennes). The forest is patchy, made up of mixed coniferous (Douglas fir) and deciduous (beech) plots. The experiment was developed as a part of the EUROFLUX and ECOCRAFT projects. The experimental set-up has been shown to provide reliable flux estimates provided that an adequate frequency correction is applied. A simple footprint model was used in order to separate the contributions to the flux of the conifer and the beech sub-plots. Saturation net ecosystem exchange decreased with increasing air saturation deficit and with decreasing temperature below 15°C. Dark respiration and quantum efficiency decreased with decreasing soil water content and, below 15°C, with decreasing temperature. These responses explain most of the seasonal behaviour of the CO2fluxes. Generally, the differences between the beech and the coniferous sub-plots were low during the full vegetation period. The differences were significant in early spring and late autumn when the leaves in the beech sub-plot were not fully developed or senescent. A relation between night CO2flux (Ne) and temperature was established. During periods of little turbulent mixing at night, there was a considerable scatter in the plot of Neversus temperature; however, after selection of the data using an appropriate turbulence criterion, a well-defined relationship between Neand temperature was established. An optimal criterion was found to be u*{\textgreater} 0.4-0.5 m s-1. No clear difference in Nebetween the conifer and the beech sub-plots was detected, probably because of bad footprint conditions at night. A first estimate of the annual carbon sequestration was made by summing the half-hourly Neand filling in the data gaps resulting from system failures or from removal of data that did not fit the quality criteria. It was found to be -0.60 kg m-2per year. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

This study investigates the effect of an exceptionally short snow season on the phenology and carbon dioxide source/sink strength of a subalpine grassland. An earlier snowmelt of more than one month caused a considerable advancement (40 days) of the beginning of the carbon uptake period (CUP) and, together with a delayed establishment of the snow season in autumn, contributed to a two-month longer CUP. The combined effect of the shorter snow season and the extended CUP led to an increase of about 100{\%} in annual carbon net uptake.

abstract = {Three years of eddy covariance measurements were used to characterize the seasonal and interannual variability of the CO2 fluxes above an alpine meadow (3250 m a.s.l.) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. This alpine meadow was a weak sink for atmospheric CO2, with a net ecosystem production (NEP) of 78.5, 91.7, and 192.5 g C m(-2) yr(-1) in 2002, 2003, and 2004, respectively. The prominent, high NEP in 2004 resulted from the combination of high gross primary production (GPP) and low ecosystem respiration (R-e) during the growing season. The period of net absorption of CO2 in 2004, 179 days, was 10 days longer than that in 2002 and 5 days longer than that in 2003. Moreover, the date on which the mean air temperature first exceeded 5.0 degrees C was 10 days earlier in 2004 (DOY110) than in 2002 or 2003. This date agrees well with that on which the green aboveground biomass (Green AGB) started to increase. The relationship between light-use efficiency and Green AGB was similar among the three years. In 2002, however, earlier senescence possibly caused low autumn GPP, and thus the annual NEP, to be lower. The low summertime R-e in 2004 was apparently caused by lower soil temperatures and the relatively lower temperature dependence of R-e in comparison with the other years. These results suggest that (1) the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau plays a potentially significant role in global carbon sequestration, because alpine meadow covers about one-third of this vast plateau, and (2) the annual NEP in the alpine meadow was comprehensively controlled by the temperature environment, including its effect on biomass growth.},

abstract = {Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) was measured in a wind-throw-disturbed upland spruce forest in the Bavarian Forest National Park (Germany) continuously over four years from 2009 to 2013 by the eddy-covariance method. Estimated annual NEE (positive values stand for a net carbon source) of the non-cleared wind-throw resulted in 347±104, 255±77, 221±66, 240±52, and 167±50gCm-2. However, two to six years after the storm event (windstorm Kyrill, January 2007) GEP was already strong, increasing from 393 (2009) to 649gCm-2yr-1(2013). Ecosystem respiration showed a high inter-annual variability during the measurement period, ranging from 656 to 816gCm-2. Carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes during snow-covered periods averaged about 0.8$\mu$molm-2s-1with only little variation. The contributions of spruces and grasses to the overall carbon exchange, and the differentiation into autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration were estimated by the biogeochemical model LandscapeDNDC (formerly MoBiLE). Comparisons with observations indicate that the model represents gross primary productivity very well, but underestimates ecosystem respiration during early spring and late autumn, and thus tends to diverge from measurements over multi-year simulation periods. These results show that (1) low productivity mountain forest sites may switch from a carbon source to a carbon sink within relatively few years after disturbance, and (2) model uncertainties are most prominently related to soil respiration, decomposition of coarse woody debris, and succession of ground cover species.},

abstract = {Eddy-covariance measurements are performed at several hundred sites all over the world on a long-term basis. The gathered data are used to characterise ecosystem exchanges of trace gases, water and energy and to validate or constrain process-based models. There is an increasing demand on standardised and comprehensive quality flagging and uncertainty quantification of these fluxes. In this paper, we review established quality assessment procedures and present a comprehensive newly composed strategy emphasising tests on high-frequency raw data, expanding existing tests on statistics, fluxes and corrections, plus quantification of errors. Moreover, representativity of fluxes is checked by footprint analysis. This strategy is applied within the recently launched TERENO network of ecosystem observatories, and its robustness is demonstrated for data acquired with different measurement set-ups. Four test data sets from TERENO and one data set from CarboEurope-IP were subjected to this quality assessment. The presented strategy is compared with established quality assessment schemes, and it is demonstrated that unrealistic fluxes are now efficiently excluded while retaining the largest possible amount of high quality data. Additionally, the algorithms applied provide comprehensive, reproducible, qualitative and quantitative uncertainty estimates for users of eddy-covariance flux data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Sabbatini_2016,
abstract = {The production of bioenergy in Europe is one of the strategies conceived to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The suitability of the land use change from a cropland (REF site) to a short rotation coppice plantation of hybrid poplar (SRC site) was investigated by comparing the GHG budgets of these two systems over 24 months in Viterbo, Italy. Eddy covariance measurements were carried out to quantify the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (FCO2), whereas chambers were used to measure N2O and CH4 emissions from soil. Soil organic carbon (SOC) of an older poplar plantation was used to estimate via a regression the SOC loss due to SRC establishment. Emissions from tractors and from production and transport of agricultural inputs (FMAN) were modelled and GHG emission offset due to fossil fuel substitution was credited to the SRC site considering the C intensity of natural gas. Emissions due to the use of the biomass (FEXP) were also considered. The suitability was finally assessed comparing the GHG budgets of the two sites. FCO2 was the higher flux in the SRC site (−3512 ± 224 g CO2 eq m−2 in two years), while in the REF site it was −1838 ± 107 g CO2 m−2 in two years. FEXP was equal to 1858 ± 240 g CO2 m−2 in 24 months in the REF site, thus basically compensating FCO2, while it was 1118 ± 521 g CO2 eq m−2 in 24 months in the SRC site. This latter could offset −379.7 ± 175.1 g CO2 eq m−2 from fossil fuel displacement. Soil CH4 and N2O fluxes were negligible. FMAN weighed 2 and 4{\%} in the GHG budgets of SRC and REF sites respectively, while the SOC loss weighed 455 ± 524 g CO2 m−2 in two years. Overall, the REF site was close to neutrality in a GHG perspective (156 ± 264 g CO2 eq m−2), while the SRC site was a net sink of −2202 ± 792 g CO2 eq m−2. In conclusion the experiment led to a positive evaluation of the conversion of cropland to bioenergy SRC from a GHG viewpoint.},

@article{AT-Neu,
abstract = {The role and relative importance of weather and cutting for the seasonal and inter-annual variability of the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) of a temperate mountain grassland was investigated. Eddy covariance CO2 flux data and associated measurements of the green plant area index and the major environmental driving forces acquired during 2001-2006 at the study site Neustift (Austria) were analyzed. Driven by three cutting events per year which kept the investigated grassland in a stage of vigorous growth, the seasonal variability of NEE was primarily modulated by gross primary productivity (GPP). The role of environmental parameters in modulating the seasonal variability of NEE was obscured by the strong response of GPP to changes in the amount of green plant area, as well as the cutting-mediated decoupling of phenological development and the seasonal course of environmental drivers. None of the environmental and management metrics examined was able to explain the inter-annual variability of annual NEE. This is thought to result from (1) a high covariance between GPP and ecosystem respiration (Reco) at the annual timescale which results in a comparatively small inter-annual variation of NEE, (2) compensating effects between carbon exchange during and outside the management period, and (3) changes in the biotic response to rather than the environmental variables per se. GPP was more important in modulating inter-annual variations in NEE in spring and before the first and second cut, while Reco explained a larger fraction of the inter-annual variability of NEE during the remaining periods, in particular the post-cut periods.},

@article{Sulman_2009,
abstract = {Wetland biogeochemistry is strongly influenced by water and temperature dynamics, and these interactions are currently poorly represented in ecosystem and climate models. A decline in water table of approximately 30 cm was observed at a wetland in Northern Wisconsin, USA over a period from 2001–2007, which was highly correlated with an increase in daily soil temperature variability. Eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide exchange were compared with measured CO2 fluxes at two nearby forests in order to distinguish wetland effects from regional trends. As wetland water table declined, both ecosystem respiration and ecosystem production increased by over 20{\%} at the wetland, while forest CO2 fluxes had no significant trends. Net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide at the wetland was not correlated with water table, but wetland evapotranspiration decreased substantially as the water table declined. These results suggest that changes in hydrology may not have a large impact on shrub wetland carbon balance over inter-annual time scales due to opposing responses in both ecosystem respiration and productivity.},
